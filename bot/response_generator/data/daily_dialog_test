{"id":33,"utterance":" Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on .

{"id":34,"utterance":" I got fired . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":34,"utterance":" How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? ","emotion":"surprise"}

{"id":34,"utterance":" Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":35,"utterance":" I needed to get something really quick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":35,"utterance":" Where did you park at ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":35,"utterance":" At my apartment building . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":35,"utterance":" Don't you have your own parking spot ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":35,"utterance":" I needed to be fast . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":38,"utterance":" I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! ","emotion":"anger"}

{"id":40,"utterance":" I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that \u2019 s why it won \u2019 t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that \u2019 s not working either . I suspect that there \u2019 s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that \u2018 s causing a blockage . That \u2019 s what \u2019 s making your toilet overflow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":40,"utterance":" Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":40,"utterance":" Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn \u2019 t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it \u2019 s urgent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":40,"utterance":" That would be great ! Is it expensive ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":40,"utterance":" Let \u2019 s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":"Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":41,"utterance":" Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" You need a babysitter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I could have Suzy stay at my place . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I don't want to do that to you , Karen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" Why not ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":41,"utterance":" Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":42,"utterance":"Good evening . What'll you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" A draft beer please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" OK . Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" Could I have some fruit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" Of course . Wait for a moment , please . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":44,"utterance":" You are welcome . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":45,"utterance":"excuse me , could you tell me which line I \u2019 m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you \u2019 ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" that \u2019 s a really long line . How long do you think it \u2019 ll take to get through all those people ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it \u2019 ll probably be about an hour \u2019 s wait . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" can I buy stamps here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":46,"utterance":" It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":" I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":" Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":" That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":" I have the same idea as yours . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":" It's OK . Please have a taste of it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":" Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":46,"utterance":" It's my pleasure . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":47,"utterance":"Room service.What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":49,"utterance":" OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":"I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" What about a draft at 120 days sight ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" So do I . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":51,"utterance":" She's probably about five feet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" That's nice , but tell me what she looks like . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" I think I might've bumped into her before . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" I believe so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":52,"utterance":"Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" Can I return the car in San Francisco ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities . ","emotion":"surprise"}

{"id":54,"utterance":"Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Sound great . Let's go ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":54,"utterance":" Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":"Where do you want to go ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" I'm going to the hospital . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" Get in . I'll take you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" About how much will it cost ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" It will cost you $ 10 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" By the way , what's the time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" Certainly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":"You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" Where was it from ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" It was made in Jingdezhen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" You are right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" It must be most precious . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" But it is really worth the price . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":58,"utterance":" Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":58,"utterance":" To hell with you . The accident was your fault . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":58,"utterance":" I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":58,"utterance":" To hell with you . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":59,"utterance":"Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" What about the performance itself ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" It surely is . And the cast is really the best . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":59,"utterance":" The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":60,"utterance":"All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":60,"utterance":" Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":60,"utterance":" I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00 ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":60,"utterance":" That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":60,"utterance":" Perhaps one year , I'm not sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":61,"utterance":"What dressing would you like on the salad ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":61,"utterance":" French dressing , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":61,"utterance":" I beg your pardon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":61,"utterance":" Oh , French dressing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":61,"utterance":" Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":61,"utterance":" We still prefer French dressing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":"Could I have some fish ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Oh , spinach , I think . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Fine , And what about something to drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Just a beer , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Good . Thank you.sir . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Would you like to have some more beer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":62,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":63,"utterance":"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" Sure . First of all , it \u2019 s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don \u2019 t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" Yeah , that's very important . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" So you \u2019 d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" I \u2019 ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" That \u2019 s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" It \u2019 s always easier to say something than to do it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" It \u2019 s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" It \u2019 s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":63,"utterance":" It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" It better be more than last year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":65,"utterance":"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":65,"utterance":" What a pity ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":65,"utterance":" If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":65,"utterance":" That's OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":66,"utterance":"Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":66,"utterance":" Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":66,"utterance":" No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":67,"utterance":" Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":67,"utterance":" Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":67,"utterance":" I would prefer the first one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":67,"utterance":" Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":68,"utterance":"Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":68,"utterance":" I need to find out some more information for L \/ C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":68,"utterance":" OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":68,"utterance":" OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":68,"utterance":" Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":68,"utterance":" That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":69,"utterance":"911 emergency . What is the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":69,"utterance":" Where was the break-in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" It happened at my house . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" Was anything stolen ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" I haven't checked yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" Why do you think there was a break-in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" My front window was broken . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" We'll send a squad car shortly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":69,"utterance":" I'd appreciate that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":"Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" One dollar . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" So , I can have five for five dollars ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Actually , you can only have four . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Okay . Thanks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":"House keeping.May I come in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" Come in please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" Well , since you have come , do it now please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":71,"utterance":" Thank you.Please get some soap for us . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":72,"utterance":" Oh ? What \u2019 s wrong ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":72,"utterance":" My daughter \u2019 s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I \u2019 m going to have to take her to the hospital . I \u2019 ll be about two hours late . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":73,"utterance":" I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":134,"utterance":" It \u2019 s still too much . Can \u2019 t you make it any cheaper than that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":139,"utterance":"Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" That's OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" That's a good idea . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" Agreed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":139,"utterance":" I understand your position . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":140,"utterance":"I want to buy a black suit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":140,"utterance":" Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":140,"utterance":" I prefer single breasted suit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":140,"utterance":" What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":140,"utterance":" That looks great . Do you have ties here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":"How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":141,"utterance":" Very well . Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":142,"utterance":"Don't I know you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":142,"utterance":" I'm not sure.You look familiar . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":142,"utterance":" You're Mr.Stevenson , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":142,"utterance":" Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":"That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" Yes , I have an overall understanding . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" When we have the final results , we will call you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" But if I don't pass , will you call me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" Then do I have the chance to get this job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" Your mentality is very good and that's great . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":143,"utterance":" My pleasure . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":144,"utterance":"I have a stomachache . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":144,"utterance":" Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":144,"utterance":" All right . I'll do that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":"What kind of personality do you think you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" What kind of people do you like to work with ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":145,"utterance":" People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":146,"utterance":"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues .

{"id":146,"utterance":" Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":"Were you in a leadership position when you were a college student ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" Did you get any honors or awards at your university ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" Were you involved in any club activities at your university ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" Yes . I was a member of the Student Poetry Society . I like writing poems in my spare time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":147,"utterance":" I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":148,"utterance":"Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":148,"utterance":" What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":148,"utterance":" Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":149,"utterance":"I think Yoga might be suitable for me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":149,"utterance":" Why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":149,"utterance":" Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":149,"utterance":" But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":149,"utterance":" I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":149,"utterance":" You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":150,"utterance":"We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":150,"utterance":" I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":150,"utterance":" How are your typing and shorthand skills ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":151,"utterance":" OK . Please fill in the form first . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":"What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" And what's the cause of that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" But I can't just slow down . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" You mean I've got to lose weight ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":152,"utterance":" Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":"You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" Do you do the same exercises every day ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":153,"utterance":" Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":154,"utterance":"I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":154,"utterance":" I think Pond's is the best . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":154,"utterance":" And they're very dear , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":154,"utterance":" They're on special offer today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":154,"utterance":" Oh , that's ideal . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":155,"utterance":"Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":155,"utterance":" First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":155,"utterance":" I will go to bed early tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":155,"utterance":" Do you have an airsickness ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":155,"utterance":" I don't know . But I have a carsickness . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":155,"utterance":" You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":155,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":"Can we choose a time to look at houses together ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" Either way is good for me . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" I would like to see as many as possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":156,"utterance":" When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":157,"utterance":"Do you have a package tour to Hollywood ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":157,"utterance":" Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":157,"utterance":" The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":157,"utterance":" $ 300 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":157,"utterance":" We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":157,"utterance":" Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":158,"utterance":"What \u2019 s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn \u2019 t belong . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":158,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":158,"utterance":" Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don \u2019 t like your way . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":159,"utterance":"Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":159,"utterance":" Enough is enough . I know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":160,"utterance":"Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":160,"utterance":" I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":212,"utterance":" Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Well , that's kind of obvious . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Give me a break , Mr Yang . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":"I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . ","emotion":"neutral"}

They \u2019 re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately .

{"id":214,"utterance":" Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Really ? I didn \u2019 t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" That \u2019 s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They \u2019 Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":214,"utterance":" Unique , aren \u2019 t they ? I bet you \u2019 Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one \u2019 s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that \u2019 s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I \u2019 m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Haggis ? What \u2019 s Haggis ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" It \u2019 s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep \u2019 s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep \u2019 s stomach . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Ah , get back to you . ","emotion":"disgust"}

{"id":217,"utterance":" I think I can handle it by myself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" I \u2019 d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn \u2019 t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" Other company rules also need your attention . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t mention it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":"Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":219,"utterance":" Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" It can \u2019 t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" You can \u2019 t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":223,"utterance":" Yeah , you \u2019 re right . We aren \u2019 t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO \u2019 s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Well , we don \u2019 t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Not in a million years ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":228,"utterance":" The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":228,"utterance":" Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":228,"utterance":" It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":228,"utterance":" It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":"Billy , you are late again . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":249,"utterance":" Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":249,"utterance":" I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":299,"utterance":" No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO \u2014 the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":299,"utterance":" How many people are on the board of directors ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":299,"utterance":" Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":300,"utterance":"How much will my pay be , if you don \u2019 t mind my asking ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":300,"utterance":" Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":300,"utterance":" No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":301,"utterance":"Mum , can I finish my homework later ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":301,"utterance":" Sorry . You know the rules . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":301,"utterance":" But I want to watch TV now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":301,"utterance":" That \u2019 s out of the question . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":301,"utterance":" Not a chance . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":313,"utterance":" Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":313,"utterance":" We \u2019 re planning on having children soon , I don \u2019 t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":313,"utterance":" Fine ! Let \u2019 s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":349,"utterance":" That's right . Just a simple multi-vitamin that I can take every day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":349,"utterance":" Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":355,"utterance":" I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":355,"utterance":" Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":355,"utterance":" Uh-huh . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":355,"utterance":" Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":356,"utterance":" I'm having a party this Friday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Oh , really ? That's nice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" I wanted to see if you wanted to come . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Doing what ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" I'm going to dinner with my family . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" I really wanted you to come , but I understand . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Yeah , maybe next time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" I'll hold you to that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Sounds like a plan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":"I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" It's simple . You can use call transfer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" Is it so simple ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" It's true . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" That's all ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":358,"utterance":"Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":358,"utterance":" Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":359,"utterance":" What else do I need to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":359,"utterance":" You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":"I \u2019 m going to be moving out soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" You still have time on your lease . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" There \u2019 s no way that I can stay here . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" That \u2019 s not going to be all right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t understand why . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" I \u2019 m going to have to keep your deposit ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" Why can \u2019 t I have it back ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":360,"utterance":" You have to give it back to me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" You \u2019 re not going to get it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" But I \u2019 m not able to live here anymore . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" I can \u2019 t help you with that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":"Can I have my check , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Here it is . 350 Yuan all together . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":362,"utterance":" No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":"Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" How often do you run your anti-virus program ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" Have you tried this one ? It \u2019 s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" Just a minute ... go to this one . I \u2019 ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" What do you use your computer for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":363,"utterance":" I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don \u2019 t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":366,"utterance":" No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":366,"utterance":" Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":367,"utterance":" Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":367,"utterance":" Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":367,"utterance":" Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":367,"utterance":" That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":367,"utterance":" OK . Anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":367,"utterance":" Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":367,"utterance":" Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":368,"utterance":"Excuse me sir . May I come in ? ","emotion":"sadness"}

{"id":368,"utterance":" Do you think I believe the story like that ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":368,"utterance":" But it's true . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":368,"utterance":" How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":368,"utterance":" That's coincident \u3002 ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":368,"utterance":" Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time \u3002 ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":369,"utterance":" Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":369,"utterance":" July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":371,"utterance":" Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" How long will it take to reach the buffet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" Not long , because people rush for lunch . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" The line sure does move fast . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" Tell the man behind the counter what you want . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" Just point to it if you don't know the name . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":371,"utterance":" All right . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":372,"utterance":"Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":376,"utterance":" Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" What ' the matter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" That's true . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" It was good . I brought lunch from home today . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Seriously ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":376,"utterance":" Yeah , it's hard to believe but true . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":377,"utterance":"Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":377,"utterance":" Good idea ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":378,"utterance":" Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":378,"utterance":" Nonsmoking , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":378,"utterance":" Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":378,"utterance":" That sounds fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":378,"utterance":" Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":379,"utterance":" Perfect . Thank you . Bye .. ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":379,"utterance":" wait ! ! I need your address ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":380,"utterance":"Hello , Personal Banking . How may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":380,"utterance":" Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":380,"utterance":" Personal Internet Banking is a self service financial service that is based on the Internet . It can be used by both businesses and individuals . We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":380,"utterance":" That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":381,"utterance":"I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":381,"utterance":" It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":381,"utterance":" Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":381,"utterance":" Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":382,"utterance":"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":382,"utterance":" Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":382,"utterance":" Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":382,"utterance":" That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":382,"utterance":" It says it's located in the suburbs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":"What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" Chicken , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" Good choice ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" What kind of drinks do you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" Anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" I would like to have some tea as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":383,"utterance":" I see . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":"I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" I'd be glad to . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" Do you have an account with this bank ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" I'm afraid not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" What is the interest rate on your card ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" That's very expensive ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" Does the card provide any other benefits ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":384,"utterance":" You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":385,"utterance":"You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":385,"utterance":" Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":385,"utterance":" You're kidding ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":385,"utterance":" No . And then I often go Rollerblading . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":385,"utterance":" Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":385,"utterance":" About five times a week . What about you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":385,"utterance":" Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":"I don't believe we've met . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":" No , I don't think we have . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":" My name is Gao Run . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":" How do you do ? My name is James Green . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":" Here's my name card . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":" And here's mine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":386,"utterance":" It's nice to finally meet you . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":387,"utterance":" Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":387,"utterance":" No , thanks . I will call back later . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":387,"utterance":" OK . Thank you . Goodbye . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":"Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" Yes , I need some traveler's checks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" How much do you need ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" Three thousand US dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" All right , can I have your passbook ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" Yes , here you go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" What amounts do you want the checks in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" It's all the same to me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":388,"utterance":" Thanks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":"The plumbing in my new apartment is not working . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" I need you to tell me what the problem is . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" The bathroom sink is stopped up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" I am not sure if I will be home later . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":389,"utterance":" I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren \u2019 t there , I \u2019 ll just use my key . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":390,"utterance":"Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" It's more violent than TV news ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" What time is it anyway ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" Nine-thirty . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" No time . That's their headlights in the window ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" Little dude , your life is over ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":390,"utterance":" No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":"How old is Keith ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" He's 21 . How old is James ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" How's your father ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" He can spend more time with his grandchildren . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" How do you want to spend your old age ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":391,"utterance":" In the same way , probably . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":392,"utterance":"Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":392,"utterance":" Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":392,"utterance":" But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":392,"utterance":" Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":392,"utterance":" It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":392,"utterance":" Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":393,"utterance":"Why not come over to work in my company ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":393,"utterance":" I need to think it over . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":393,"utterance":" Tell me what you need . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":393,"utterance":" All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":394,"utterance":"We are approaching the top of the mountain . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":394,"utterance":" What a beautiful view we have here . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":394,"utterance":" Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":394,"utterance":" Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":394,"utterance":" Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":"what did you do last night ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" I just stayed at home and watched TV . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" yes , it was a very evenly matched game . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" what were the results of the game ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" it ended in a tie . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" what was the actual score ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" it was three all . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" what happened ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" that explains it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" how many more games are left this season ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" that was the last game before the playoffs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" when do the playoffs start ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" sure , that would be great . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" Ok , it's a date then ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":396,"utterance":"how are you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":396,"utterance":" I \u2019 m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It \u2019 s hard to keep track of everything around here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":396,"utterance":" That \u2019 s for sure . You \u2019 re new , too , huh ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":396,"utterance":" Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":"Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" Gave me the receipt , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" Here is my receipt . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" What's wrong with it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" It's too small for me to wear . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" Would you like another bigger one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" No thanks . I want to have a refund . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":397,"utterance":" OK , here is your money . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":"Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" What is your favorite color , miss ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Red . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Here you are.It ' s very attractive . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" May I try it on ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Go ahead . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Is there a mirror around here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Right over there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Does it suit me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" Yes , you look very nice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" How much is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":398,"utterance":" That's quite reasonable . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":399,"utterance":"What can I help you with ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" May I ask you something ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" What's your question ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" How many hours behind the wheel do I need ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" What do you need to take it for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" I'm trying to get my license . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" You need six hours . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" Can I do all six hours in one day ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" You have to do it in three days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" That's all I have to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" That's everything . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":399,"utterance":" Well , that's a relief . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":400,"utterance":"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" All right . Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":400,"utterance":" Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":"Here you are . You left the medicine here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" Sorry . I was too worried . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":"What kind of place shall we rent ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" How much do you think the rent will be ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":"I have a terrible toothache . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Which tooth is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" This one here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Ar , Yes . There \u2019 s a big cavity . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Can you fill it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" I \u2019 m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Then I might as well have it done now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" you \u2019 d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":404,"utterance":"May I have a look at that vase , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":404,"utterance":" Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":404,"utterance":" Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":404,"utterance":" Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":405,"utterance":"Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" The local newspaper has ads for housing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" What do landlords charge for rent ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Sure , I \u2019 ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":406,"utterance":" No problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":"The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Why is the price so high ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Model of computers aren't compatible ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" But by then , the technology will be outdated . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" I guess you get what you pay for . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":409,"utterance":" I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" No , no . I've got plenty left . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" What am I going to do about souvenirs ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":410,"utterance":" Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":415,"utterance":" I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" An excellent idea . Work now and play later . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":415,"utterance":" No , now it's bedtime . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":"Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Well , it's all new stock in the window now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I \u2019 d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it \u2019 s exactly what you are looking for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":417,"utterance":" I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":" But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":" I agree that yours are of the top . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":" Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":" To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":" Impossible . How about 5 % off ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":" Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":"So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":421,"utterance":" Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" Sorry , it had been sold out . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" What a pity ! ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":422,"utterance":"I \u2019 d like to apply for a personal loan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":422,"utterance":" How much would you like to borrow ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":422,"utterance":" A thousand dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":424,"utterance":" I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":" That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":" A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":" A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":" But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":" We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":" I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":425,"utterance":"Hello . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":425,"utterance":" Hi . It \u2019 s Tony calling from the dentist \u2019 s office . Is Lily there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":425,"utterance":" Sure . What \u2019 s your number , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":425,"utterance":" 519 367 8901 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":425,"utterance":" Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":425,"utterance":" Yes . I \u2019 m Tony . Thank you very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":425,"utterance":" You \u2019 re welcome . Bye . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":425,"utterance":" Bye . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":"So what do you think of my new dress ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" Um , ninety-five dollars ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":427,"utterance":"Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":427,"utterance":" I did . Why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":427,"utterance":" Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":427,"utterance":" No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":428,"utterance":"Is it Fred's fault ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":428,"utterance":" No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":428,"utterance":" But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":"In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" How to adjust ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" Yes , sometimes the differences are great . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":429,"utterance":" We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":430,"utterance":"I hate doing the damn laundry . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":430,"utterance":" Watch your language . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":"I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" $ 10 per person . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" Here are $ 30 . By the way , where can I find a guide ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" Turn to the next window and they will help you find one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" Thanks a lot . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":432,"utterance":"Shall we share a taxi ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" Where are you heading now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" That's the one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" You mean we'll share the taxi ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":501,"utterance":" Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" The whole stadium is to be finished this June . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" How many seats are there in the stand ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" Oh , there are 5000 seats in total . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" I didn \u2019 t know it would be so big ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":501,"utterance":" We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":502,"utterance":"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":502,"utterance":" OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":502,"utterance":" I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":502,"utterance":" Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":502,"utterance":" Oh , great idea ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":503,"utterance":"So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":503,"utterance":" Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":503,"utterance":" That \u2019 s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":503,"utterance":" What was so bad about it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":503,"utterance":" Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":503,"utterance":" Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn \u2019 t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":503,"utterance":" Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":"Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Yes , that \u2019 s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Yes , I \u2019 m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Yes that \u2019 s right . I \u2019 Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I \u2019 m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Well I \u2019 Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" What did that involve ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sure . Okay , now let \u2019 s move on to your work experience , shall we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":504,"utterance":" Yes , okay . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":505,"utterance":"Could you change these for me , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":505,"utterance":" What would you like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":505,"utterance":" Twenties and some smaller bills , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":505,"utterance":" Anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":505,"utterance":" Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":506,"utterance":"Now , what seems to be the trouble ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":506,"utterance":" It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":506,"utterance":" Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":506,"utterance":" Yes , I never seem to have any energy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":506,"utterance":" I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":506,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":507,"utterance":"Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":507,"utterance":" Do you have a map of the campus ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":507,"utterance":" Yes , I have , but it doesn \u2019 t help me very much . I \u2019 m not very good at reading maps . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":507,"utterance":" Do you know where your classes are ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":507,"utterance":" More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don \u2019 t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":507,"utterance":" That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":508,"utterance":"Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":508,"utterance":" Which train do you like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":508,"utterance":" T112 to Washington please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":508,"utterance":" May I have your name ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":508,"utterance":" That's Lincoln . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":"Will you be voting ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" I can \u2019 t wait to vote . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" Who are you voting for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" The person I \u2019 m voting for is the best . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" What do you like about him ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" He is very intelligent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" You think so ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" That \u2019 s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" I \u2019 m glad to hear that you are so excited . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" I \u2019 m voting for the next President . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sure he will be . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":509,"utterance":" I \u2019 m going to make sure and vote . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":"Good morning . May I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" What's the 14 pounds for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" That's for the phone calls you made from your room . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Can I pay with traveller's cheques ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Certainly . May I have your passport , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Could you sign each cheque here for me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":510,"utterance":" Thank you . Goodbye . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":511,"utterance":"What type of people do you work with most effectively ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" What things impress you in your colleagues ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" How do you organize and plan for major projects ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" How do you manage your time in a typical day ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk \/ return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":511,"utterance":" I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":512,"utterance":"Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":512,"utterance":" Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":512,"utterance":" I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":512,"utterance":" Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":512,"utterance":" It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":513,"utterance":"I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":513,"utterance":" You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":513,"utterance":" What did he say ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":513,"utterance":" He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":513,"utterance":" He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":"Want to send out for some Chinese ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" Some what ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":514,"utterance":" Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":515,"utterance":"Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":515,"utterance":" I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":515,"utterance":" It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":515,"utterance":" Is that true ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":515,"utterance":" Definitely ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":515,"utterance":" If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":"Hello sir , how may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" It \u2019 s not really an occasion , it \u2019 s more like I \u2019 m sorry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" I think I \u2019 m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" Mmm , well this is our I \u2019 m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":516,"utterance":" Get out of my store , you jerk ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":517,"utterance":"I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" How many people are on the waiting list right now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":517,"utterance":" Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":518,"utterance":"How do you think they could be ended ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":518,"utterance":" I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":518,"utterance":" So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":518,"utterance":" It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":518,"utterance":" Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":519,"utterance":"You still have not given me those files I \u2019 Ve asked you for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":519,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sorry , Mr . Myers . I \u2019 Ve just been so busy today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":519,"utterance":" I really don \u2019 t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We \u2019 re running a busy office here . You \u2019 re going to have to keep up . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":519,"utterance":" You \u2019 re right , sir . I apologize . I \u2019 ll get those files for you now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":520,"utterance":"What sort of job would you like to take ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":520,"utterance":" I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":520,"utterance":" We need an operator now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":520,"utterance":" It's just the job I've been searching for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":"I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" And it takes up all the news . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":521,"utterance":" Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":"Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":" I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":" Sure . No problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":" Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":" Sure . Do you have my number ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":" Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":522,"utterance":" No problem . I'll wait for your call . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":"What are you typing there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" I'm working on my resume . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" I didn \u2019 t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" Sure you have to be patient . But I think it \u2019 s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":523,"utterance":" How do you know if you don \u2019 t have a try ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":"Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" Is this the one you want ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" No , the one next to it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" Yes , please . How much is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" It costs $ 200 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":524,"utterance":" It looks good . OK . I'll take it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":525,"utterance":"Happy birthday , Jim ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":525,"utterance":" Thank you , Lisa . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":525,"utterance":" Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":525,"utterance":" Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":525,"utterance":" I'm very glad to hear that . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":525,"utterance":" Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":"What's wrong with you ? You look pale . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" When did the trouble start ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" I was sick most of the night . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" Have I got a high fever ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" Yes , I have . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - ' ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" Aaaaahh , aaaaahh . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" All right , thanks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" What shall I do today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":526,"utterance":" I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":527,"utterance":"I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":527,"utterance":" You can be sure of that , sir . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":527,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":"I called HP about my computer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" What did they say ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" They said I need a new hard drive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" That's too bad . How much is a new one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" It's not too much , only about $ 85 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" Plus installation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" Really ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" Yes , it's just a couple of screws . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" That's nice . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":528,"utterance":" If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":529,"utterance":"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":529,"utterance":" Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":529,"utterance":" Yes , Mum . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":"Is there anything wrong ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" I \u2019 m worried about my daughter . She can \u2019 t decide about college . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t worry . That \u2019 s just a part of being a teenager . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn \u2019 t affect her decision . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" But I just want to give her some tips . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" Oh , she can make her own decisions . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" I guess you are right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" Believe me . Everything will be ok . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":530,"utterance":" I hope so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":531,"utterance":"It's beautiful here . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":531,"utterance":" Yes . I feel refreshed . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":531,"utterance":" How long will we dock ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":531,"utterance":" In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":531,"utterance":" Yes . We come at the right time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":"that was a really good meal , Gordon . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" let's see how much the bill is . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" you've got a deal . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" great . Bye . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":532,"utterance":" bye . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":533,"utterance":"I hear you are planning to travel abroad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":533,"utterance":" Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":533,"utterance":" In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":533,"utterance":" Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":533,"utterance":" Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":533,"utterance":" And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":534,"utterance":"This looks like a very nice house . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" The style of the exterior is just what I \u2019 Ve been looking for ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" This home is gorgeous on the inside ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" The master suite is the best . Let \u2019 s go look at that next . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":534,"utterance":" I know that you like this house , but let \u2019 s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":535,"utterance":"Room service.What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":535,"utterance":" l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":535,"utterance":" Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":535,"utterance":" Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":"Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" Sure . When do you want to take the plane ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" Next Monday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" Will that be first class or economy seat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" What's the fare for a first class seat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" $ 200 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":536,"utterance":" Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":537,"utterance":"Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":537,"utterance":" Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":537,"utterance":" That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":537,"utterance":" And I can purchase that here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":537,"utterance":" Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":538,"utterance":"Are there any beds vacant ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":538,"utterance":" Yes , what kind of room do you want ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":538,"utterance":" I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":538,"utterance":" Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":538,"utterance":" Well , that's fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":539,"utterance":"Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":539,"utterance":" That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":539,"utterance":" You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":539,"utterance":" Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":539,"utterance":" Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":539,"utterance":" Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":539,"utterance":" Well , welcome to the team . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":540,"utterance":"Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":540,"utterance":" Oh , thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":540,"utterance":" Is there anything I can do for you now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":540,"utterance":" Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":540,"utterance":" Certainly , sir . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":"Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" Marry Lin please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" All right , could I leave a message ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" Certainly ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" Please ask her to call John . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":"Excuse me . Where is the way out ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" Well , that's what I'm looking for myself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" It should be the way out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" OK . Let's go and see . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":543,"utterance":"Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":543,"utterance":" Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":543,"utterance":" I think you should be more careful next time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":543,"utterance":" Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":544,"utterance":"Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":544,"utterance":" Look , Sally . I \u2019 Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":544,"utterance":" No , I \u2019 m sorry . I disagree . I don \u2019 t think you \u2019 Ve been working at full speed at all . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":544,"utterance":" Well . I \u2019 m sorry you feel that way . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":545,"utterance":"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" Things are going well for me , Joe . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" Want to go see a movie tonight ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" What movie did you want to see ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" I was thinking that I would like to see \u201c The Secret Life of Bees . \u201d ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":545,"utterance":" Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":546,"utterance":"How's the bride-to-be ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":546,"utterance":" Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":546,"utterance":" Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":546,"utterance":" I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! ","emotion":"fear"}
{"id":546,"utterance":" Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":546,"utterance":" You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":546,"utterance":" I will . Don't worry ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":547,"utterance":"Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Nothing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Promise that you won't get angry . ","emotion":"fear"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" OK , I promise . What is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" It's a kitty . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":547,"utterance":" I will . Thank you , Mummy . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":548,"utterance":"I was wondering if you could help me with something . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" Sure , anything you say . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" Actually , it \u2019 s a little bit silly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t worry about it , just ask . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" You need to know the type of shoes you want . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":548,"utterance":" Let me write all that down . I \u2019 m going shopping this afternoon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":549,"utterance":"Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":549,"utterance":" It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":549,"utterance":" So , it has a history for more than a decade ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":549,"utterance":" Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":550,"utterance":"What can I do for you , Madam ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":550,"utterance":" Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":550,"utterance":" Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":550,"utterance":" Well , everything really . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":550,"utterance":" All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":551,"utterance":"Let's do something outdoors today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":551,"utterance":" All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":551,"utterance":" Okay . what do you want to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":551,"utterance":" I want to go jogging . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":551,"utterance":" All right . That sounds like fun . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":552,"utterance":"Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":552,"utterance":" I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":552,"utterance":" But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":"The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":553,"utterance":" Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":554,"utterance":"Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":554,"utterance":" We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":554,"utterance":" You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":554,"utterance":" OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":554,"utterance":" I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":554,"utterance":" OK , will do . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":555,"utterance":"I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":555,"utterance":" What size do you want ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":555,"utterance":" I wear size 40 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":555,"utterance":" How about this one ? It's the latest design . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":555,"utterance":" Oh , I like the color . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":556,"utterance":"May I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" I'm looking for a pair of shoes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" How much are they ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" They are $ 168 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":556,"utterance":" I'll take them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":557,"utterance":"A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":557,"utterance":" I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":557,"utterance":" Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":557,"utterance":" Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":557,"utterance":" Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":557,"utterance":" Ok , then we can sign up for it together . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":558,"utterance":"Who's it knocking at the door ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":558,"utterance":" I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":558,"utterance":" All right . I'll get it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":559,"utterance":"Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":559,"utterance":" No , we don't . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":559,"utterance":" How many of you , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":559,"utterance":" Six , including two kids . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":559,"utterance":" I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" Are you saying that there weren \u2019 t any problems ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" How will I know what the numbers mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":560,"utterance":" We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" What's your proposal ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" What would you suggest ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":561,"utterance":" OK . We can meet halfway again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":"Hello . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" Oh , you mean Canal Street ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" I cannot get hold of her yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" See you around , Carl . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":562,"utterance":" See you later . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":563,"utterance":"Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":563,"utterance":" Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":563,"utterance":" What about your use of raw materials ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":563,"utterance":" Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we \u2019 re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":563,"utterance":" What happens if you exceed the limits ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":563,"utterance":" We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":564,"utterance":"Have you got any better ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":564,"utterance":" That's the best there is . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":564,"utterance":" Okay , I'll take one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":564,"utterance":" That'll be $ 200 , sir . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":565,"utterance":"Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":565,"utterance":" Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":565,"utterance":" No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":566,"utterance":"What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":566,"utterance":" External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":569,"utterance":" people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":569,"utterance":" I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":589,"utterance":" That \u2019 s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We \u2019 ll need someone to hire staff . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":589,"utterance":" I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don \u2019 t think we should use an agency , because they won \u2019 t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":589,"utterance":" Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":589,"utterance":" The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":589,"utterance":" Yes . We \u2019 Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":589,"utterance":" When will the branch office open ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":589,"utterance":" Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":589,"utterance":" Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":591,"utterance":"did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" what do you think about abortion ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" why not ? It's their children , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":591,"utterance":" that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":592,"utterance":"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":592,"utterance":" But I don't have any reading assignments . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":592,"utterance":" Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":633,"utterance":" Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":633,"utterance":" But now you are rich . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":635,"utterance":" Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":635,"utterance":" That's a problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":644,"utterance":" I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":644,"utterance":" I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":644,"utterance":" I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":645,"utterance":" Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":646,"utterance":"... so , I said , let \u2019 s take a break.And since that night , I \u2019 Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven \u2019 t heard from him . You don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s seeing someone else , do you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" Come on , don \u2019 t be so dramatic ! I \u2019 m sure everything is going to work out just fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I \u2019 m sure he \u2019 s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn \u2019 t he call ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":646,"utterance":" But I ... I still love him ! And it \u2019 s all my fault ! I can \u2019 t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it \u2019 s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I \u2019 Ve totally messed this up ! ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I \u2019 m sure he \u2019 ll forgive you ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I \u2019 Ve ruined everything ... ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" do you hear something ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":"what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" to be honest , I was just dumped . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":647,"utterance":" come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" where is that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" what's there to see ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" oh , sounds nice . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":648,"utterance":"Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" Yes , just once . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" What was the reason ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":"Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" Oh , I can't . I have a date ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":649,"utterance":" This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" Stay for dinner with us . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":651,"utterance":" Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What \u2019 s on your mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" We need to talk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Okay ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" I \u2019 Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" What ? Why ? I mean , we \u2019 Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we \u2019 re happy together , aren \u2019 t we ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" That \u2019 s just it , I \u2019 m not happy anymore , Tim . It \u2019 s not you , it \u2019 s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" So , what are you saying ? You \u2019 re breaking up with me because I \u2019 m perfect ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I \u2019 ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I \u2019 d only hurt you , I know I \u2019 d only make you cry . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Baby , come on . Don \u2019 t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don \u2019 t leave me . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" I can \u2019 t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I \u2019 m only doing this for you . I don \u2019 t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Laura ... ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Here are your keys . I \u2019 ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I \u2019 m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I \u2019 ll always love you . Goodbye . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":652,"utterance":"Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" How about a training course ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" A training course ? That must be costly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" OK , let's have a try . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":"Have you seen the new James Bond movie ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Oh , yes . You ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":653,"utterance":" I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Yes ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":654,"utterance":"My friend Jean is very beautiful . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":655,"utterance":"Where are you going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" I'm going to buy a CD . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" Why not listen to music online ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" Can you recommend some to me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" Certainly . Realplayer is a good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" Can I download it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":655,"utterance":" I'll try it tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":656,"utterance":"What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":656,"utterance":" Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":656,"utterance":" Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":656,"utterance":" He asked me how long it took me to learn English . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":656,"utterance":" I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":659,"utterance":" that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":659,"utterance":" it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":659,"utterance":" what should I bring with me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":659,"utterance":" we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":661,"utterance":"I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":661,"utterance":" Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":661,"utterance":" No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":661,"utterance":" Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":661,"utterance":" Good idea . That might help . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":667,"utterance":" What if we can't get to school ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":667,"utterance":" You can only miss one class without penalty . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":667,"utterance":" If we have a major problem , will you let us know ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":667,"utterance":" I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":668,"utterance":"We're thinking about going to America . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":671,"utterance":" three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn \u2019 t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" did your husband's family get to meet your family ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":671,"utterance":" not at all , but we don \u2019 t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":672,"utterance":" I know . I wonder what's keeping him . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":672,"utterance":" Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":672,"utterance":" Yeah , a number of times . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":672,"utterance":" What's he trying to pull anyway . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":672,"utterance":" I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":672,"utterance":" Maybe you should start seeing someone else . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":672,"utterance":" You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":679,"utterance":" I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":679,"utterance":" I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":679,"utterance":" It must have really hurt afterwards . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":679,"utterance":" Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn \u2019 t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":684,"utterance":" Let's hope it clears up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":685,"utterance":"Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":685,"utterance":" Yeah , I'm afraid so . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":685,"utterance":" If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":685,"utterance":" Yes , it is annoying . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":686,"utterance":"Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":686,"utterance":" Nothing particular . But , ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":686,"utterance":" What's the matter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":686,"utterance":" I , I don't know how to explain it to you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":686,"utterance":" Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":686,"utterance":" Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":688,"utterance":" You're welcome . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":689,"utterance":"I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":689,"utterance":" That's all right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":"Hey , what's new ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":" Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":" Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":" What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":" Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":" That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":690,"utterance":" But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":691,"utterance":"Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" That sounds great . Where are you going ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" What should I bring ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":692,"utterance":"What do you think of doctor Thomson ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":692,"utterance":" I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":692,"utterance":" How can you be so sure ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":692,"utterance":" I can tell form the way he spoke to us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":692,"utterance":" Never believe his words . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":693,"utterance":"Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":693,"utterance":" I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":693,"utterance":" Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":693,"utterance":" Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":"What do you think about violence in movies ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":695,"utterance":"Are you free tomorrow night ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":695,"utterance":" Yes , I am . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":695,"utterance":" Shall we have dinner together ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":695,"utterance":" Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":695,"utterance":" Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":695,"utterance":" OK . I'll be happy to join you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":696,"utterance":"If only our company prescribe flex time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":696,"utterance":" The board has been considering introducing flex time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":696,"utterance":" Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":696,"utterance":" Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":697,"utterance":"Brian , do you know how to speak English ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Where did you learn ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" I learned in college . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" You speak really well . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" How long have you been in the U . S . ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" 3 weeks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Is your wife with you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Yes , she just got here yesterday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Have you been to California before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" No . I've never been there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":697,"utterance":" Yes . I went there once on a business trip . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":"How are the children doing at sport ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" I \u2019 m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That \u2019 s very fast for a kid his age . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" He \u2019 s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" He \u2019 s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy \u2019 s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that \u2019 s fine for someone his age . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" How are they at swimming ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" They \u2019 re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That \u2019 s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They \u2019 re not very fast , but that \u2019 s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" I \u2019 d be afraid to jump from that height ! ","emotion":"fear"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" I think that these kinds haven \u2019 t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":698,"utterance":" It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":699,"utterance":"Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Is everything ready now ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don \u2019 t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":699,"utterance":" My pleasure . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":700,"utterance":"Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" Sorry , I thought you knew . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" But you should have told me you were in love with her . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" Didn't I ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" You know you didn't . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" Well , I'm telling you now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" Yes , but you might have told me before . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" I didn't think you'd be interested . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":700,"utterance":" Oh , you men ! You're all the same . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":701,"utterance":"Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":701,"utterance":" Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":701,"utterance":" What about water pollution instead of pollution ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":"How \u2019 s it going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" I \u2019 m fine . Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" Do you need anything ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" I need you to help me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" I am looking for an article in a newspaper . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" Did you check the periodicals ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" I didn \u2019 t even bother to think of that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" I \u2019 ll show you where to find your article . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" I get lost in this library . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" It \u2019 s right this way . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":702,"utterance":" Thanks a lot for your help . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":703,"utterance":"How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":703,"utterance":" Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":703,"utterance":" No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":703,"utterance":" All right . See you tomorrow night . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":704,"utterance":"Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":704,"utterance":" I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":704,"utterance":" Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":704,"utterance":" I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":704,"utterance":" Why don't you take a few days off ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":704,"utterance":" I can't . I am really behind of my work . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":705,"utterance":"Can you speak Japanese ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" Yes , I can , but not very well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" Where did you learn it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" At school . And I'm still learning it now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" How long have you been learning it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" About three years . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" Can you speak any other languages ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":705,"utterance":" I'm afraid not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":706,"utterance":"Good afternoon , Johnson . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":706,"utterance":" Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":706,"utterance":" Not bad , thanks . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":707,"utterance":"I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" You'd better pay more attention to your health . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" I will , thanks for your concern . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":707,"utterance":" You're welcome . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":708,"utterance":"It is too bad today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":708,"utterance":" What happened ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":708,"utterance":" My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":708,"utterance":" How did you find him at last ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":708,"utterance":" It was the police wo helped me to do that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":708,"utterance":" It must have taught you a lesson this time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":709,"utterance":"I want to give our kitchen the works . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":709,"utterance":" Why ? I think it \u2019 s convenient and good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":709,"utterance":" No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It \u2019 s modern . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":709,"utterance":" Why should we run after the fashion ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":709,"utterance":" I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":710,"utterance":"Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":710,"utterance":" I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":710,"utterance":" Then tell me what's good about it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":710,"utterance":" It can't be expressed by words . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":711,"utterance":"What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":711,"utterance":" I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":712,"utterance":"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won \u2019 t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you \u2019 ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":713,"utterance":"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":713,"utterance":" Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":713,"utterance":" Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":713,"utterance":" That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":713,"utterance":" Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":713,"utterance":" Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":714,"utterance":"Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" What ? Why do we have to do that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" I see . That \u2019 s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that \u2019 s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" That \u2019 s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It \u2019 s like we went back in time ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":"I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" Yes , I \u2018 d love to . it \u2019 s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" I \u2018 m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" You \u2019 re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What \u2019 s you favourite award category ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":715,"utterance":" It \u2019 s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":716,"utterance":"How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":716,"utterance":" We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":716,"utterance":" Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":716,"utterance":" But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":"How do you celebrate national day in your country ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" What kinds of parades are there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" We don \u2019 t have a national day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" Really ? That \u2019 s unusual . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don \u2019 t . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":717,"utterance":" Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":718,"utterance":"Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":718,"utterance":" No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":718,"utterance":" Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":718,"utterance":" Do you have any brothers or sisters ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":718,"utterance":" Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":718,"utterance":" Do you see them a lot ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":718,"utterance":" Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":719,"utterance":"Hey , how was the show ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":719,"utterance":" Not great . It's a kind of boring . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":719,"utterance":" Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":719,"utterance":" Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":720,"utterance":"What happened , John ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" Nothing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" Why do you look unhappy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" I \u2019 m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" Oh , cheer up . He \u2019 ll understand you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" I hope so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":721,"utterance":"You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":721,"utterance":" Really ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":721,"utterance":" But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":749,"utterance":" She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":749,"utterance":" For example ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":749,"utterance":" Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":749,"utterance":" No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":797,"utterance":" I didn't know you had a brother . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" Does your brother have just one son ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" So when are they all coming ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":797,"utterance":" My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":798,"utterance":"You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":798,"utterance":" I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":798,"utterance":" Where did you spend your holiday ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":798,"utterance":" I went to Paris . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":"So , Paula , where are you from ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" I'm from Canada , originally . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" From Canada ? Where were you born ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" Montreal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" When did you come to Los Angeles ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" We moved here when I was fourteen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" Did you go to school here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" Did you get a job right after graduation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" When was that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" Let's see ... That was about six years ago . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":799,"utterance":" I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":800,"utterance":"Do you consider yourself a good mother ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":800,"utterance":" Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":800,"utterance":" How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":800,"utterance":" I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":800,"utterance":" Does your husband feel the same ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":800,"utterance":" Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":801,"utterance":"I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" I often do , but I \u2019 m worried about the responses from other people . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" I \u2019 m worried that what I say will not make sense . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" that \u2019 s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" that \u2019 s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" I didn \u2019 t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":801,"utterance":" the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can \u2019 t be sure how . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":802,"utterance":"What's his job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":802,"utterance":" He used to be a policeman . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":802,"utterance":" But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":802,"utterance":" Yeah . He's a private eye now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":803,"utterance":"Bother the flies ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":803,"utterance":" Where do they come from ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":803,"utterance":" I don't know . Something rotten here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":803,"utterance":" I can't see it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":"Have you got your invitation yet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" The house warming party . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Whose house warming party is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" It's out in the suburbs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Have you seen the house ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Is it nice ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" There's also a garden . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" When are they going to have the party ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Wow , that would be something to look forward to . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":805,"utterance":"hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":806,"utterance":"Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Sounds good . Where are we going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Whew ! That getup is terrific ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" That too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" I'm gonna introduce myself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" If you're lucky , that might do the trick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":806,"utterance":" OK , catch you later . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":807,"utterance":"Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It \u2019 s been such a long time ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":807,"utterance":" Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven \u2019 t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" Ha ha , come on ! Well , I \u2019 Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" But of course ! Well , it \u2019 s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" That would be great ! Give me a call ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can \u2019 t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":808,"utterance":"Did you already take the history exam ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Good luck . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Thanks . See ya . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":809,"utterance":"What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" It's us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" What do you mean by \" us \" ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":809,"utterance":" What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":"Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Yes.Do you like it ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Is classical music your favorite ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Yes . What about you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Did you always like pop music . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":811,"utterance":"It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":811,"utterance":" Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":811,"utterance":" Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":811,"utterance":" Fortunately , things are changing these years . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":"Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":812,"utterance":" Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":813,"utterance":"Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Yeah , I \u2019 m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Oh , do you go hiking often ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Well , bring him along too . We \u2019 ll have a great time this weekend . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":813,"utterance":" Thanks , I \u2019 ll ask him . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":814,"utterance":"How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":814,"utterance":" I don't know if anything terrible has happened . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":814,"utterance":" I have reported it to the police . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":814,"utterance":" We'd better prepare for the worst . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":815,"utterance":"You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":815,"utterance":" He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":815,"utterance":" I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":815,"utterance":" I can think of better things to dream about ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":815,"utterance":" Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":815,"utterance":" That's crazy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":"Mike ! Look at the floor ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" What's wrong with it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" Oh ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" Sorry , love . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" What are you looking for now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" My cigarettes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":816,"utterance":" In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":"Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" Are you Chinese by birth ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" How do you like it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" I like it so far . But my English still needs work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":817,"utterance":" I want to study Mandarin and public relations . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":818,"utterance":" It's possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":819,"utterance":"You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":819,"utterance":" What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":820,"utterance":"Let \u2019 s play a game ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" OK ! How about Scrabble ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I \u2019 m going to describe someone \u2019 s face , and you guess who it is ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" OK ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" Let \u2019 s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" Your future husband ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":820,"utterance":" Not funny . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":821,"utterance":"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":821,"utterance":" It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":821,"utterance":" Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":821,"utterance":" For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":821,"utterance":" That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":821,"utterance":" Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":822,"utterance":"Lee , I'm going to get married next month . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":822,"utterance":" Good news ! And congratulations ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":822,"utterance":" You are invited to my wedding . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":822,"utterance":" Thank you . I'll certainly be there . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":823,"utterance":"Thank you for lending me the book . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":823,"utterance":" Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":823,"utterance":" But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":824,"utterance":"Don \u2019 t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":824,"utterance":" I \u2019 m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":824,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t you think in that case , there wouldn \u2019 t be so much stealing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":824,"utterance":" Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":"The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" Yeah . I think I can find it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" You're back already . That sure was quick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":825,"utterance":" Okay , let's go ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":826,"utterance":"hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" really impressive . These two genres are totally different . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" sure . I enjoy both of them very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" how often do you go to the cinema ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" movie salon ? where is that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" is it good ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" yes , you can find almost all new releases there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":826,"utterance":" why not ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":"Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" Three months . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" There are so many things you have to prepare for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" It really must be an exciting time for you guys . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":827,"utterance":" Thank you so much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":828,"utterance":"Mary seems depressed . What \u2019 s the matter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":828,"utterance":" She didn \u2019 t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day \u2019 s hard work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":828,"utterance":" Poor girl ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":829,"utterance":"Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":829,"utterance":" Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":829,"utterance":" That's what I'm wondering , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":829,"utterance":" I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":830,"utterance":"Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":830,"utterance":" Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":830,"utterance":" We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":830,"utterance":" Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":830,"utterance":" What a pity ! You can't join us . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":830,"utterance":" So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":831,"utterance":"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" I prefer sea food . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" See you later . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":831,"utterance":" bye . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":832,"utterance":"Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":832,"utterance":" If that happen to me , I \u2019 ll take them back to the shop . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":832,"utterance":" I did . But they said they won \u2019 t change them . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":832,"utterance":" That \u2019 s terrible . But if they wouldn \u2019 t change them , I know what I would do . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":"Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" Totally agree . What is your solution ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" But I don \u2019 t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":833,"utterance":" I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":834,"utterance":"I am so busy today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" Can I help you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" I \u2019 m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" I \u2019 ll be glad to help . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" Or maybe make the beds . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" All you have to do is ask for help . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" Thanks . That \u2019 s terrific ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":834,"utterance":" I \u2019 m ready and willing to help . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":835,"utterance":"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":835,"utterance":" Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":835,"utterance":" Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":835,"utterance":" Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":835,"utterance":" I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":835,"utterance":" You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":"You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Do you feel ok ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Zach , what's that on your arm ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":836,"utterance":" Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":837,"utterance":"I can't go to your party . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":837,"utterance":" That's too bad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":"Do you like being a doctor ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" Can you tell me about it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" What can you do when this happens ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":839,"utterance":"Have you eaten ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":839,"utterance":" Not yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":"It's too hot to read . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" We'd better go out for a walk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" Which season do you like best ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" Spring . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" How about summer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" I dislike it most . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" Why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" Because the hottest season is summer in a year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":840,"utterance":" But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":841,"utterance":"My son came home from three years in the navy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":841,"utterance":" It was a real red letter day for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":841,"utterance":" Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":842,"utterance":"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":842,"utterance":" Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":842,"utterance":" It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":842,"utterance":" You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":843,"utterance":"I must be going . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":843,"utterance":" Okay . Keep in touch . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" But the reservation keeps the car here . That \u2019 s why you have the reservation . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" I know why we have reservations . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t think you do.If you did , I \u2019 d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don \u2019 t know how to hold the reservation and that \u2019 s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" But we do have a compact or an SUV if you \u2019 d like . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" Fine . I \u2019 ll take the compact . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":844,"utterance":" Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":845,"utterance":"Do you think Tom will be elected president ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":845,"utterance":" No , I think Harry will get it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":845,"utterance":" Let's make a bet on who gets it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":845,"utterance":" OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":846,"utterance":"I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":846,"utterance":" Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":846,"utterance":" You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn \u2019 t that strict ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":846,"utterance":" To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":846,"utterance":" But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they \u2019 re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":"What happened ? Why didn't he win ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":847,"utterance":" Let's hope so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":848,"utterance":"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":848,"utterance":" That's because Americans love sitcoms . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":848,"utterance":" Sitcoms ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":848,"utterance":" Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":848,"utterance":" In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":848,"utterance":" I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":849,"utterance":"Are you interested in history ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" I love history , but I \u2019 Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" Some people say that history repeats itself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":849,"utterance":" I see . I think I \u2019 d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":850,"utterance":"You're looking great . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":850,"utterance":" You , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":851,"utterance":"What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" Yes , they say I would get a big sum . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" Have you discussed it with your wife ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" Yes , she leaves it to me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":851,"utterance":" I have to think about it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":852,"utterance":"Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":852,"utterance":" Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":852,"utterance":" Of course . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":"I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" That \u2019 s great . He \u2019 s the best runner I \u2019 Ve seen this season . I \u2019 m sure he \u2019 ll win a medal at the Olympics . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" I think you \u2019 re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we \u2019 ll win ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" I really don \u2019 t know . I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" What do you think our chance are in other events . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we \u2019 ll do well in those same events . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" You are very optimistic ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":"Helen , did you hear I \u2019 m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" Well , drop by if you can . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" I will , do you want me to bring anything ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":855,"utterance":"It's said that John's broken up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" I hear that John's leading a double wife . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":856,"utterance":"Let's play chess . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" I haven't played chess for a long time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" You're a very good player ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" Not really , but once I won a prize . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":"You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Yeah , about . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Do you know Chinese better now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" A shouting match ? You \u2019 re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don \u2019 t believe it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" I am not exaggerating at all . I \u2019 m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don \u2019 t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it \u2019 s quite natural to us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Yes , absolutely true . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Harry Potter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Got it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Have you ever read this book before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" No , but my little brother likes it very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" It's really a good book . You will like it too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Jane Austen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" I guess we'll see just around . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" You too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":860,"utterance":"Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":892,"utterance":" I found it very disappointing . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":892,"utterance":" She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":892,"utterance":" I wasn't happy with it . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":892,"utterance":" Nothing is to your satisfaction . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":"Honey , I \u2019 ll be right back ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" Where are you going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" I told you already ! I \u2019 m going to get my nails done . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" Why ? I don \u2019 t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" They don \u2019 t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":893,"utterance":" Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":894,"utterance":"Good afternoon ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" What's the weather like in your country ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Mm ... It's quite warm now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Where do you live ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" In London.Where do you live ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":894,"utterance":" Here.Near this school . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":"I \u2019 Ve had it ! I \u2019 m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" That \u2019 s exactly what I am going to do ! I \u2019 Ve decided to create my own company ! I \u2019 m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Have you ever written up a business plan before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Well , no , it can \u2019 t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that \u2019 s it , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" You couldn \u2019 t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Well , that seems easy enough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Wait , there \u2019 s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors \u2019 ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Geez . Is that all ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":895,"utterance":" Umm . I think I \u2019 ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":896,"utterance":"I hear that Mary got mad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":896,"utterance":" So I heard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":896,"utterance":" What \u2019 s wrong with her ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":896,"utterance":" She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":897,"utterance":"Um , what will you do this weekend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":897,"utterance":" How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":897,"utterance":" A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":897,"utterance":" No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":897,"utterance":" Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":898,"utterance":"What \u2019 s on TV tonight ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" Oh , come on . That \u2019 s such a girl \u2019 s show . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" No it \u2019 s not . It \u2019 s just funny . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" Yeah , if you \u2019 re a girl . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" That \u2019 s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" It \u2019 s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" O . K . , O . K . Let \u2019 s forget it . There \u2019 s a football game on too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":898,"utterance":" No way . I \u2019 m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John \u2019 s to watch the game . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":899,"utterance":"It \u2019 s really terrible ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":899,"utterance":" What are you talking about ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":899,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t you see many parents are forcing there children \u2019 s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":899,"utterance":" You said it . Many parents just don \u2019 t know how to educate their children . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":"Sarah , what did you do today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" I went shopping . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" Did you buy anything ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" Yes , I bought a few things . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" What did you buy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" I bought this coat . Do you like it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" At the mall on 5th street . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" Was it expensive ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" That's cheap . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" I know . It was a really good deal . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":900,"utterance":" I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":901,"utterance":"Hi , Victor . How are you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" Oh , I'm fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" So , are you going to go to class tonight ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" Maybe ... but I don't think so . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" Really ? What's the matter ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":901,"utterance":" Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":902,"utterance":"How's John doing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":902,"utterance":" He can barely make ends meet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":903,"utterance":"The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":903,"utterance":" They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":903,"utterance":" If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":903,"utterance":" No way , if it still has 21 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":"What's that book you have under your arm ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":" It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":" How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":" I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":" Is it really worth paying for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":" I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":904,"utterance":" If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":"Come on , you are left behind ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" You just need more exercise . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" But running so fast is not good for people over forties . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" Why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" But I want to burn up more calories ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":905,"utterance":" Really ? I will slow down then . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":906,"utterance":"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Fine , thank you . I haven \u2019 t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" But it's really exciting . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Yep . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":906,"utterance":" Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":907,"utterance":"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":907,"utterance":" The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":907,"utterance":" Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":907,"utterance":" It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":"Are you an art aficionado ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren \u2019 t you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn \u2019 t pay much attention in art class at school . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" Art isn \u2019 t for everyone . I \u2019 m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It \u2019 s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I \u2019 d love to go with you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" I thought I \u2019 d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":908,"utterance":" Let \u2019 s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":909,"utterance":"What does your mother do , may I ask ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":909,"utterance":" My mother works in a company as an accountant . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":909,"utterance":" Is she busy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":909,"utterance":" Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":910,"utterance":"Hello , Bessie . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":910,"utterance":" Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":910,"utterance":" My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":910,"utterance":" I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":910,"utterance":" Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":910,"utterance":" Now let me sing \" Happy birthday \" for you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":910,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":911,"utterance":"Nice day , isn't it ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":911,"utterance":" It sure is . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":911,"utterance":" It's a good day for a picnic . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":912,"utterance":"Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" I don't want to . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" Well , come over and talk to me then . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" Certainly not . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" May I turn on the TV then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" Turn on the TV for what ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":912,"utterance":" To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":913,"utterance":"Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":913,"utterance":" Brian ! How have you been ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":913,"utterance":" Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":913,"utterance":" Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":913,"utterance":" Well , you look great ! How are you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":913,"utterance":" I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":913,"utterance":" That's terrific ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":914,"utterance":"How is your new dormitory ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":914,"utterance":" It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":914,"utterance":" Well , do you all major in the same subject ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":914,"utterance":" No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":914,"utterance":" That's great ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":915,"utterance":"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" Well , I swim and run every day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" Now , tell me , what do you eat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" What do you drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":915,"utterance":" Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":"What \u2019 s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" How hard is the climb ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" What did you do last week ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I \u2019 m sorry I missed it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" Yeah , I will . See you then ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":916,"utterance":" O . K . See you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":917,"utterance":"How many languages can you speak ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":917,"utterance":" I can speak French and German . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":917,"utterance":" How well can you speak them ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":917,"utterance":" I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":917,"utterance":" Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":917,"utterance":" No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":918,"utterance":"Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":918,"utterance":" Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":918,"utterance":" It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":918,"utterance":" You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":918,"utterance":" Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":918,"utterance":" It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":919,"utterance":"Do you really have to work today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":919,"utterance":" Yes . I'm afraid so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":919,"utterance":" But you'll miss out on the football game . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":919,"utterance":" Oh . Well , it can't be helped . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":920,"utterance":"How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":920,"utterance":" Oh , do you really think so ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":920,"utterance":" Of course , otherwise you \u2019 ll just have to wait for hours . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":920,"utterance":" But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":921,"utterance":"I had an accident . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":921,"utterance":" That's terrible ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":922,"utterance":"I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":922,"utterance":" You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":923,"utterance":"Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":923,"utterance":" Come on ! You're pulling my leg . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":923,"utterance":" Really ! Here's my trophy . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":923,"utterance":" Wow ! Congratulations ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":"What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Is that your wedding ring ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" In June . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Thank you so much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" What kind of watch is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" It's a Tag Heer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":924,"utterance":" Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":925,"utterance":"I'm really mad at Bob . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":925,"utterance":" What for ? ( Why ? ) ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":"Hi , Jack , how have you been ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Not very well . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Nothing . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Maybe you're right . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":926,"utterance":" Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":927,"utterance":"Do you know Sally ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":927,"utterance":" Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":927,"utterance":" Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":927,"utterance":" Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":928,"utterance":"Excuse me . Do you have the time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":928,"utterance":" My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":965,"utterance":" Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don \u2019 t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven \u2019 t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn \u2019 t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":965,"utterance":" Wow , I didn \u2019 t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":965,"utterance":" The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":965,"utterance":" Let \u2019 s do it ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":966,"utterance":"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven \u2019 t seen you for a while . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":966,"utterance":" I \u2019 m fine . I \u2019 Ve been out of town . I just got back . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":966,"utterance":" Where were you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":966,"utterance":" I was in New York for a wedding . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":967,"utterance":"Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":967,"utterance":" Don't feel like it . I'm broke . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":967,"utterance":" Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":967,"utterance":" Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":967,"utterance":" I'll go myself then . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" come on , nothing can be that bad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" I've fallen in love with my boss . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" really ? Is he married ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" no , of course not . He is still single . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" then what's your problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" office romance is very tricky . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":968,"utterance":" cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":"You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" With the job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" With everything , with everybody , with all this ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" It wasn't always like this , you know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":969,"utterance":" Certainly , perhaps . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":970,"utterance":"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" Hey , Isabelle ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" Yes , I am the guy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" What a bummer ! You set me up ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" Why did you lie to me in the email ? ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":970,"utterance":" I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" Well , I swim and run every day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" Now , tell me , what do you eat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" What do you drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":971,"utterance":" What do you drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":"Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":" Yeah . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":" Who won ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":" China . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":" What was the score ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":" China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":972,"utterance":" Wonderful ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":973,"utterance":"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":973,"utterance":" I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":973,"utterance":" Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":973,"utterance":" I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":973,"utterance":" It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":973,"utterance":" Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":"Isn't it wonderful walking here ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" What's there after that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" What are they all for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":974,"utterance":" Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" And your parents took it badly ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":975,"utterance":" I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":976,"utterance":"Do you think they two will get married ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":976,"utterance":" Yeah , you can count on it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":976,"utterance":" I think so . Yes , they get along so well . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":976,"utterance":" I like him . He's good for her . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":976,"utterance":" You're right . He sure is . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":977,"utterance":"What do you think of Frank ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":977,"utterance":" He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":977,"utterance":" Why do you say that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":977,"utterance":" Whatever things get tough , he gives in . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":978,"utterance":"Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":978,"utterance":" Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":978,"utterance":" I sure hope so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" It must be interesting to study English . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":979,"utterance":" Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":980,"utterance":"It's quiet everywhere in winter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" Yes . I like winter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" Me too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" That's a good idea . Let's go ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" Yes . Very wonderful . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" There is a snowman over there . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":980,"utterance":" How lovely it is ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":981,"utterance":"Tim's always bothering me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":981,"utterance":" Just tell him off . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":982,"utterance":"Who are those guys ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O \u2019 Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers \u2019 star players . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Oh . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" All right ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Here comes Jordan , though . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Wow , Michael Jordan \u2019 s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Yeah . He \u2019 s older , so he doesn \u2019 t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it \u2019 s still amazing . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" Which team do you think will win ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":982,"utterance":" The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":983,"utterance":"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" It's ok . What do you want to ask ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" The first place you should go is the International Center . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" Why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" Can we get any more help at the International Center ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" I see . It must be worth going to . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":983,"utterance":" It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":984,"utterance":"hi , Lander . What's wrong ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" I can hardly make ends meet these days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" is that inflation ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" has the government taken some measures to curb it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" how ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":984,"utterance":" sounds a good idea . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":985,"utterance":"OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":985,"utterance":" You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":985,"utterance":" Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":985,"utterance":" You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":985,"utterance":" The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":985,"utterance":" Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":"Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" What ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" What is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" That makes you feel uncomfortable ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Yeah . we never do that in a public office . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Yeah . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":986,"utterance":" Oh , I'm shocked . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":987,"utterance":"What courses did you take in college ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":987,"utterance":" I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":987,"utterance":" Which course did you like best ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":987,"utterance":" I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":988,"utterance":"Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" Certainly . What's the matter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" Is the service charged ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" No . it's free . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":988,"utterance":" Really . I'll get a computer at once . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":989,"utterance":"We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":989,"utterance":" It \u2019 s so cool ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":990,"utterance":"Excuse me , is this seat taken ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":990,"utterance":" I \u2019 m afraid this seat is taken . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":990,"utterance":" Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":990,"utterance":" You \u2019 re welcome . Why don \u2019 t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":990,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":991,"utterance":"I prefer potatoes to eggplants . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":991,"utterance":" I feel eggplants are more nutritious . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":991,"utterance":" But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":991,"utterance":" Oh , that's how you see it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":992,"utterance":"Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":992,"utterance":" Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":992,"utterance":" It's a deal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":993,"utterance":"Where do you plan to go this winter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":993,"utterance":" Alps , suppose . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":993,"utterance":" Oh , yes , you like skiing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":993,"utterance":" Right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":994,"utterance":"Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":994,"utterance":" You were showing respect and admiration for them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":994,"utterance":" I wish I were a hero . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":995,"utterance":"Frank \u2019 s getting married , do you believe this ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":995,"utterance":" Is he really ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":995,"utterance":" Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":995,"utterance":" Who is he marring ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":995,"utterance":" A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":995,"utterance":" Have they set a date for the wedding ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":995,"utterance":" Not yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":996,"utterance":"OK . Come back into the classroom , class . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":996,"utterance":" Does the class start again , Mam ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":996,"utterance":" Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":996,"utterance":" Oh , breaktime flies . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":996,"utterance":" Come on , baby . It \u2019 s time now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":996,"utterance":" Mam , another minute , could I ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":996,"utterance":" Hurry up , little boy . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":997,"utterance":" well , I can \u2019 t just imagine it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":998,"utterance":"Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":998,"utterance":" Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":998,"utterance":" Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":999,"utterance":"What a nice day ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
