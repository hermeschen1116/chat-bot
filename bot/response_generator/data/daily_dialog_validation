{"id":1,"utterance":" Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":1,"utterance":" Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":1,"utterance":" As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":1,"utterance":" I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":3,"utterance":" I guess I have to send it by airmail . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":11,"utterance":"Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":11,"utterance":" Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":11,"utterance":" Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":11,"utterance":" So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":11,"utterance":" Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":"Dear , time is up , let \u2019 s go there now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Just a minute . I \u2019 m putting on my clothes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Have you taken the key to the door ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Yes . Oh , dear , I can \u2019 t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Where have you put it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" I put it in the dressing room . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Are you sure ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Yes , quite sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Then , have you looked downstairs ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Yes , I \u2019 Ve looked everywhere downstairs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Look , dear . It \u2019 s over there . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" Where ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":12,"utterance":" On the floor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":"Excuse me , sir . You can't park here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":" I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":" Sir , the curb here is not for parking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":" But I didn't see the sign , Ma \u2019 am . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":" There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":" I didn't see it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":13,"utterance":" I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":14,"utterance":"Are you a goal-oriented person ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" Where do you want to be in 5 years ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" That sounds very reasonable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" It's the most important thing to me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" What is your long-range objective ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" I haven't thought it over at all . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":14,"utterance":" I think the most important thing is the interest in the job . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":"I'd like to open a current account . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":" Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":" Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":" Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":" Why is that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":" It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":15,"utterance":" I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":"Good morning , Helen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" Good morning , Steven . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" It'll be a national campaign starting next week . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" What style will the ads be ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":16,"utterance":" Definitely . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":"I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" That's fine . You must try this dish . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" Is it good ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" Sure . It's a most popular dish . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" What kind do you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" We have French and Thousand Island . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":17,"utterance":" Make it Thousand Island . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":"Taxi ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" Where will you go , sir ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" Friendship Hotel . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" OK , it's not far from here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" How much should I pay you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" The reading on the meter is 15 yuan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" Here's 20 yuan , keep the change . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":18,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":19,"utterance":"Mr . Johnson \u2019 s office . Cindy speaking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":19,"utterance":" Hi , Cindy . It \u2019 s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":19,"utterance":" No , I \u2019 m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He \u2019 s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":19,"utterance":" Yeah , that \u2019 ll be great . I \u2019 m on extension 4283 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":"Hi , Mark . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Hi , Bill . I \u2019 d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" All right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" So , what do we do now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I \u2019 ll deposit one month \u2019 s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month \u2019 s rent in advance . I understand that I \u2019 ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Can I pay you by check ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Sure . A check will be fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Is there a laundry room in the basement ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":20,"utterance":" Can I sign the lease right now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":"Good morning ! What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" How much does a six-day tour by train cost ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" Five hundred yuan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" Does that include hotels and meals ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" Eight hundred and fifty yuan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" Covering all expenses ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":21,"utterance":" Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":22,"utterance":"I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":22,"utterance":" Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":23,"utterance":"ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":23,"utterance":" Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I \u2019 m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company \u2019 s website . Is it still available ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":23,"utterance":" The notification period of my current job is not that long and I \u2019 m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I \u2019 m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":25,"utterance":" I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":25,"utterance":" What was your problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":25,"utterance":" My stomach was bothering me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":25,"utterance":" Are you feeling any better ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":25,"utterance":" I'm still feeling a little sick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":25,"utterance":" I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":25,"utterance":" I'd appreciate that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":"Excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" Including my keys ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" Yes , and please step over there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" All right . What shall I do now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" I've got film in my bag . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" That's all right . This machine will not damage the film . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" That's fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" Sure . Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":26,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":26,"utterance":" Thank you and goodbye . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":"Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":" I \u2019 d like extra prints made of these photos . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":" Do you have your negatives ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":" Yes.Here they are . I \u2019 Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":" What size do you want the prints ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":" Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":27,"utterance":" Okay , they \u2019 ll be ready for you in an hour . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":"Is there anything I can do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":" I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":" Well , we have a package tour there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":" How much does it cost ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":" $ 600 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":" Does that include the insurance ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":28,"utterance":" Of course . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":"Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" That sounds good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":29,"utterance":" You mean to saya ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":30,"utterance":" I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":30,"utterance":" But that's what the ad said . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":32,"utterance":" I \u2019 m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! ","emotion":"anger"}

{"id":37,"utterance":" No , I don't risk it . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":39,"utterance":"Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":39,"utterance":" There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":39,"utterance":" I must've missed it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":39,"utterance":" Is this your first time flying ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":39,"utterance":" Yes . I'm going to San Francisco . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":39,"utterance":" Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":39,"utterance":" Hey , I'm feeling much better already . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":42,"utterance":" I always drink too much wine in the evening . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" You shan't drink more wine in the evening . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" Yes , you are right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" And you'd take some exercise every day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":42,"utterance":" Many thanks for your advice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":43,"utterance":"Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":43,"utterance":" Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":43,"utterance":" Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":43,"utterance":" What about Rubella and Mumps ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":43,"utterance":" Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":43,"utterance":" OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":43,"utterance":" We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":"I \u2019 m interested in teaching at your school . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Great . Are you a qualified teacher ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" What kind of teaching certificate do you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" I have a TEFL certificate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" How many years of experience do you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" When did you get your TEFL certificate ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Why do you want to teach at our school ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Well , I \u2019 Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" That \u2019 s great . Can you speak Chinese ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Yes , just a little . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" I sure can . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":44,"utterance":" Great . See you then . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":"Why is the car before us stopping ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" What's going on ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" More and more people easily get irritated while driving . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":45,"utterance":" Yes . This is what is called road rage . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":46,"utterance":"This is today \u2019 s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o \u2019 clock , live for the workshop where you \u2019 ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":46,"utterance":" At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o \u2019 clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":"This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":47,"utterance":" Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":48,"utterance":"Hi , my name is Tom . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Nice to meet you too.Melinda . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" It looks like you guys work hard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":48,"utterance":" Sure thing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":"What do you think of our price ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" I \u2019 m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" We've already cut down our price to cost level . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" Is that all ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" Yes , this is the best we can do . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":49,"utterance":" I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":"So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" It \u2019 s great , dad . I don \u2019 t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" Even though you are only twelve , it \u2019 s not too early to start saving a little money . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" I \u2019 Ve never had a bank account before . Why don \u2019 t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" But what if I need my money suddenly ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" Great ! So it \u2019 s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don \u2019 t have to worry about that yet . Let \u2019 s go make your first depot ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":50,"utterance":" OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":51,"utterance":"Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" Which bus do I have to change ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":51,"utterance":" I see . Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":52,"utterance":"Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":52,"utterance":" Sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":53,"utterance":"Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":53,"utterance":" We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":53,"utterance":" Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":53,"utterance":" Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":"Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":54,"utterance":" Okay , that's good . I get it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":55,"utterance":"Kate , you never believe what's happened . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" Masha and Hero are getting divorced . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" You are kidding . What happened ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":55,"utterance":" Early in the New Year I guess . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":"Overseas operator . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" Your name , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" Tim Chen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" What's the number , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":56,"utterance":" The line is connected . Please go ahead . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":57,"utterance":"Hello . Excuse me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Yes . Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Of course I remember you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" I think I lost my wallet here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" No . It's been empty the whole time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" No . My friend did . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Should I call the police ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":57,"utterance":" Thanks for your help . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":64,"utterance":" What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":64,"utterance":" That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":69,"utterance":" Bye . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":"Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":70,"utterance":" Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":"Hello ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":71,"utterance":" I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" Oh , right . What time is it there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" Yes - four o'clock in the morning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":71,"utterance":" That's OK . I'm awake now . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":72,"utterance":"John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":72,"utterance":" I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":73,"utterance":"Jack , let \u2019 s go ! ","emotion":"fear"}
{"id":73,"utterance":" Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":73,"utterance":" Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! ","emotion":"fear"}
{"id":73,"utterance":" Take it easy . They will get caught . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":74,"utterance":"Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":74,"utterance":" Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":74,"utterance":" I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":74,"utterance":" I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":74,"utterance":" That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":74,"utterance":" My pleasure , bye ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":75,"utterance":"Excuse me , Miss . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" What's your flight number ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" Flight CA216 to Chengdu . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" Yes , it's true . It has been delayed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" Could you please tell me why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":75,"utterance":" Bye ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":"What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I don't know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I have plenty of gas . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" So what can we do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Alright . That's a good idea . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Days ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":76,"utterance":" Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":"Hey , buddy , can \u2019 t you see there \u2019 s a line ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" Oh , sorry . I didn \u2019 t know . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" What ? You haven \u2019 t taken the bus before ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" No , I \u2019 m afraid not . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" Sorry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" It \u2019 s all right . Where are you going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" I wanted to see the White House . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" Oh , well you don \u2019 t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" Oh , no . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" It \u2019 s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" Oh , well thank you very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":77,"utterance":" You \u2019 re welcome . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":78,"utterance":"Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" What kind of drink would you like with that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" Just coke will be fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" Yes , that's all . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" That will be 25RMB , please ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":78,"utterance":" You got it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":79,"utterance":"Do you have any night tours ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":79,"utterance":" Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":79,"utterance":" Is that a guided tour ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":79,"utterance":" Yes , it is . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":79,"utterance":" That's fine . Let's get on the bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":80,"utterance":"I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":80,"utterance":" That's nice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":80,"utterance":" We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":80,"utterance":" Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":"I would like to purchase some meat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" What kind of meat would you like to get today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" That's perfect . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" What else will you be needing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" What's the total price for the chicken ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" It's going to be $ 12.15 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":81,"utterance":" Okay , I think that will be all for me today . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":82,"utterance":"I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Do you sell direct to shops ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Do you keep a stock of these things ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" That is , your commission . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":82,"utterance":" Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":83,"utterance":"Excuse me , I \u2019 m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":83,"utterance":" Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":83,"utterance":" Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn \u2019 t arrived yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":83,"utterance":" Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":"Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" Are the prices on the list firm offers ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":84,"utterance":" I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":"Hello sir , may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" Sounds good . I don \u2019 t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" What about Wi-fi ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":85,"utterance":" One last thing . Is it waterproof ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":86,"utterance":"We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":86,"utterance":" Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":86,"utterance":" Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":86,"utterance":" I will ! I \u2019 ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":86,"utterance":" What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":86,"utterance":" Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":95,"utterance":" We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp \u2019 s . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":95,"utterance":" Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":95,"utterance":" Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp \u2019 s . most mp \u2019 s vote the way their party wants them to . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":95,"utterance":" How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":95,"utterance":" They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":96,"utterance":" I told him that I hadn \u2019 t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":96,"utterance":" Did he want to know the reasons ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":164,"utterance":" This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":164,"utterance":" Yes , sir.Go ahead . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":164,"utterance":" Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":164,"utterance":" Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":164,"utterance":" It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":164,"utterance":" But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":164,"utterance":" They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":167,"utterance":" OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":167,"utterance":" What useful treatment can you offer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":167,"utterance":" I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":168,"utterance":"Miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":168,"utterance":" Sure , why not ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":168,"utterance":" This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":172,"utterance":" Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":172,"utterance":" I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":172,"utterance":" What happened ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":172,"utterance":" I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":173,"utterance":"Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":173,"utterance":" Not really . I like looking on the internet at what \u2019 s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I \u2019 m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I \u2019 ll look at something in a shop , but lat ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":173,"utterance":" No . I \u2019 m a little worried about security . You never know who \u2019 s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren \u2019 t you worry about that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":173,"utterance":" Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s the best way to sho ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":173,"utterance":" I \u2019 m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":175,"utterance":"Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":175,"utterance":" Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":175,"utterance":" But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":175,"utterance":" More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":175,"utterance":" Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":175,"utterance":" It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":176,"utterance":" You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":176,"utterance":" But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":176,"utterance":" Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":176,"utterance":" Can any unit see my information ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":176,"utterance":" It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":176,"utterance":" Which websites offer this service ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":179,"utterance":" I was pulled over for allegedly speeding . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" Are you sure you weren't speeding ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" To be honest , I really wasn't . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" What speed were you going ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":179,"utterance":" Don't worry about it . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":185,"utterance":" Please sign here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":"Are you ready to order ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":186,"utterance":" You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":187,"utterance":"I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":187,"utterance":" Are you sure you're using the right program ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":187,"utterance":" Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":187,"utterance":" That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":188,"utterance":"What kind of character do you think you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":188,"utterance":" Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":188,"utterance":" They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":188,"utterance":" What personality do you admire ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":188,"utterance":" I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":188,"utterance":" How do you get along with others ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":188,"utterance":" I get on well with others . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":189,"utterance":"Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":189,"utterance":" What seems to be the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":189,"utterance":" I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":189,"utterance":" Do you have a fever with that rash ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":190,"utterance":" It \u2019 s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":190,"utterance":" Really ? Then , I guess I won \u2019 t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":190,"utterance":" Actually , you might because there \u2019 s a big convention in town this weekend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":190,"utterance":" I \u2019 m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":191,"utterance":"Hello , how can I help you today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":191,"utterance":" I'd like to withdraw some money from my account . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":191,"utterance":" Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":191,"utterance":" Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":191,"utterance":" Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":192,"utterance":"Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":192,"utterance":" Do you have many different suppliers ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":192,"utterance":" Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":"Mary , can you tell me how you keep in shape ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" Now , tell me what you often eat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" I often eat fish and eggs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" What do you like to drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":193,"utterance":" Whatever would you like to drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":193,"utterance":" How often do you exercise ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":194,"utterance":" Why do you need to leave early ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t feel so good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" What doesn \u2019 t feel right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" I have some medicine at home that I could take . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":194,"utterance":" We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":195,"utterance":"Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":195,"utterance":" It \u2019 s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":196,"utterance":"We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" This is already our best price . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" Well , what would you suggest ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" Could you make it $ 4500 ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" Can we meet each other half way ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":196,"utterance":" You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":197,"utterance":"I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":197,"utterance":" Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":197,"utterance":" My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":197,"utterance":" What kind of watch is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":197,"utterance":" It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":197,"utterance":" Yes , we have it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":197,"utterance":" Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":198,"utterance":"What are your thoughts on the apartment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" I think that it \u2019 s absolutely gorgeous . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" There aren \u2019 t any problems with the apartment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" What problems ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" I did notice a few stains in the carpet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" You will ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" I \u2019 m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":198,"utterance":" It is . I love it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":199,"utterance":"That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" Absolutely . Here it is . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" Could I try it on ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" Please do , the fitting-room is over there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" OK . How much does it cost ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":199,"utterance":" It's 486 yuan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":"Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":200,"utterance":" Good . Friday morning at 9 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":201,"utterance":"Good morning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":201,"utterance":" Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":201,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sorry She isn \u2019 t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ? ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":201,"utterance":" Thank you.But I will call her later ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":201,"utterance":" OK.Goodbye . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":201,"utterance":" Goodbye . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":202,"utterance":"Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":202,"utterance":" I \u2019 m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":202,"utterance":" Late night ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":202,"utterance":" Yeah , I got home around two . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":"We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" Have you got the time , Tom ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" But you bought it only last month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" How long will it take us to get there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" I think about ten minutes by bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":203,"utterance":" Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":"Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Ok . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":204,"utterance":" Ok , thanks doctor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":"Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" Sure , please hold on . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" You are so kind , you helped me a lot . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":205,"utterance":" You are welcome . Bye ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":206,"utterance":"Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" I'm afraid so , yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" What do you recommend we do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":206,"utterance":" I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":"Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" You should go to the dentist . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" I hate dentists . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" It always hurts . I hate going . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" O . K . , O . K . , I \u2019 ll go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":207,"utterance":" Good . You'll feel better after you do . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":"Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" How long does it take to get there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you \u2019 d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" Great ! I \u2019 ll take it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" I understand . Thank you very much ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":208,"utterance":" Have a great trip . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":209,"utterance":"I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" It sounds like it will be . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" I really hope it doesn't get cold . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" That is true . The weather is constantly changing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" It would be nice if the weather would never change . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":209,"utterance":" True . Predictable weather would make life easier . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":210,"utterance":"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":210,"utterance":" If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":210,"utterance":" Beneficial ? I don \u2019 t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":210,"utterance":" But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":210,"utterance":" I doubt that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":211,"utterance":"Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":211,"utterance":" Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":211,"utterance":" You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":211,"utterance":" What's special about these things ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":211,"utterance":" Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":211,"utterance":" Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":212,"utterance":"I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Is that so ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Have you decided ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Yes . I want to get a better job . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Could you tell me why you want to quit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Thank you so much for your advice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" And every best wish for your new job . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":212,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":"The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":" Let me see . Oh , No . 11 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":" Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":" Seats No . 20 and 21 . It \u2019 s nice that we \u2019 Ve got a window seat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":" Let's put our suitcases on the rack . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":" Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":213,"utterance":" All right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":"So , how should we get to the theatre ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Let's take the bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" Thanks , that was nice of you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":214,"utterance":" See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":"Let's go over this plan again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" And that is mostly flat , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":215,"utterance":" Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":216,"utterance":"Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":216,"utterance":" I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":216,"utterance":" I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":216,"utterance":" Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":216,"utterance":" No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":216,"utterance":" All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":216,"utterance":" Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":"It's time for bed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" Why don't you try counting sheep ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" I promise I'll go to sleep soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":217,"utterance":" See you in the morning . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":218,"utterance":"I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" How about your psychological resilience ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":218,"utterance":" I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":"Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":219,"utterance":" Fine . At 3:30 ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":220,"utterance":"I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":220,"utterance":" Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":220,"utterance":" Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":220,"utterance":" Nice meeting you , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":221,"utterance":"I made my little brother cry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":221,"utterance":" Shame on you ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":222,"utterance":"I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":222,"utterance":" Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":222,"utterance":" Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":222,"utterance":" We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":222,"utterance":" Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":222,"utterance":" I can help you with that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":222,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":223,"utterance":"Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Yes , we are on the same plane . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Yes.It ' s quite troublesome . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":223,"utterance":" Why not go and find a porter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":"Billy , you don \u2019 t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" But Mom ! Today we \u2019 re playing football ! I love football ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" You \u2019 Ve got a fever and playing football isn \u2019 t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What \u2019 s that on your arm ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" It \u2019 s rash . I \u2019 d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" I bashed it against the chair in my room . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" Does it hurt ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" A little , but not much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I \u2019 ll take you to the doctor \u2019 s after breakfast . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" If I \u2019 m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":224,"utterance":" If you are better , but I doubt you will be . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":225,"utterance":"This is your schedule . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":225,"utterance":" You're going out of your way for us , I believe . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":225,"utterance":" You are our honored guests . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":226,"utterance":"Are there any vacancies still available ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":226,"utterance":" Yes . We need a plumber here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":226,"utterance":" I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":226,"utterance":" I am sorry . They are not available now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":"My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" You know , that is one of my favorites ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" OK , I'll take one order of that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" You could choose another appetizer for half price to share . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":227,"utterance":" Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":228,"utterance":"I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":228,"utterance":" What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":228,"utterance":" Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":228,"utterance":" Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":"I would like to speak to you , if you don \u2019 t mind . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" What would you like to speak to me about ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" I would like to talk to you about this year \u2019 s election . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" Is that right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" I am a volunteer for this year \u2019 s campaign . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" That \u2019 s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" That \u2019 s fantastic . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" Are you planning on voting ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" I \u2019 m going to vote . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" Go to your polling place early on Election Day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":229,"utterance":" I will . Good luck with your volunteering . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":230,"utterance":"We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":230,"utterance":" Yes . I promise it will not happen again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":230,"utterance":" We look forward to your settlement at an early date . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":230,"utterance":" We will inform you as soon as possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":231,"utterance":"Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":231,"utterance":" OK , let's go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":232,"utterance":"Where on earth are we ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":232,"utterance":" Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":232,"utterance":" What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":232,"utterance":" I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":232,"utterance":" Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":232,"utterance":" It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":"Hello . Front desk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I \u2019 m calling from room number 627 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Is it possible to change to another room ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Could you please tell me why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" My room is facing the swimming pool . It \u2019 s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" You \u2019 re right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" I \u2019 Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" That \u2019 s fine . Can I move now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Sure . I \u2019 ll send the bellman to help you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" Oh , thank you kindly . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":233,"utterance":" You \u2019 re welcome . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":234,"utterance":"How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":234,"utterance":" Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":234,"utterance":" Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":234,"utterance":" No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":235,"utterance":"Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":235,"utterance":" Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":235,"utterance":" No , nothing in particular . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":235,"utterance":" You may ask questions about us , if you have any . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":235,"utterance":" All right . When can I start ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":"What are you doing here today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" I would like to fight my ticket . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" Yes , the officer is here today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" What's your case ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" Do you believe that the officer lied ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" Your license plate was caught on camera ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" A picture of my license plate was never taken . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":236,"utterance":" Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":237,"utterance":"Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":237,"utterance":" After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I \u2019 m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":"what shall we do after the volleyball match ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" me , too . What did you have in mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" I agree . They're very lovely , especially \" Huan Huan \" . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" any other ideas ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":238,"utterance":" it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":239,"utterance":"Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" You don \u2019 t have to eat them . I don \u2019 t mind . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" But I don \u2019 t like them ! It \u2019 s not fair ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" Ok ... actually , I don \u2019 t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" I \u2019 ll remember that for next time . You \u2019 ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":239,"utterance":" Thanks mom ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":240,"utterance":"It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" It \u2019 s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What \u2019 s your general impression , may I ask ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" That \u2019 s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":240,"utterance":" Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":241,"utterance":"Is the factory fully-automated ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":241,"utterance":" Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":241,"utterance":" What about supply of parts to the production line ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":241,"utterance":" Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":241,"utterance":" What about the smaller components ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":241,"utterance":" They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":242,"utterance":"I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":242,"utterance":" Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":242,"utterance":" That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":242,"utterance":" I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":280,"utterance":" Would you like to go by train or by bus ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":280,"utterance":" I am not sure , which one is better ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":280,"utterance":" How do I get to King's Cross ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":280,"utterance":" The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":280,"utterance":" Can you show me on the map ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":280,"utterance":" It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":280,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":280,"utterance":" You're welcome . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":281,"utterance":"Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":281,"utterance":" From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":281,"utterance":" Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":281,"utterance":" here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":281,"utterance":" Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":281,"utterance":" We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":281,"utterance":" Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":285,"utterance":"The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" Is there anything wrong ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We \u2019 ll send our technicians to repair them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":285,"utterance":" All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":286,"utterance":"Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":287,"utterance":" Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":287,"utterance":" Sure , when those never ending meetings . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":288,"utterance":"I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":288,"utterance":" No , I haven't had the pleasure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":288,"utterance":" Come and meet her now . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":289,"utterance":"Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":289,"utterance":" Did you have hotel card or something ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":289,"utterance":" Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":289,"utterance":" Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":289,"utterance":" I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":290,"utterance":"The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I \u2019 m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" So , let \u2019 s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You \u2019 Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren \u2019 t they ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don \u2019 t need to be replaced . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" How long did it take you to do the tiling . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" As I hadn \u2019 t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" I think you \u2019 Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":290,"utterance":" You \u2019 ll be lucky ! However , I \u2019 ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":291,"utterance":"I'd like to see that pen , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" You mean this one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" No , the other one in the brown case . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" Oh , this one ... Here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" May I try it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" Sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" It's very smooth . I'll take it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" Cash or charge ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":291,"utterance":" Charge , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":"I \u2019 Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" Why , your price has soared . It \u2019 s almost 25 % higher than last year \u2019 s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" I \u2019 m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" I \u2019 m afraid I can \u2019 t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we \u2019 Ve received from other sources . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US \u2019 s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" I agree that yours are of better quality . But there \u2019 s competition from synthetic products , too . You can \u2019 t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven \u2019 t changed much over the years . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" There \u2019 s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That \u2019 s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":292,"utterance":" Well , we \u2019 ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I \u2019 ll have to try , I suppose . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":"Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":" Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":" Of course not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":" Why do you want to go to the US ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":" I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":" Will you get any kind of scholarship ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":293,"utterance":" Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":294,"utterance":"Could you say something about your educational background ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":294,"utterance":" Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":295,"utterance":" It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" What about the later deposits ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" OK , that's good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" Your ID , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":295,"utterance":" Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":296,"utterance":" So , what experience do you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I would rather work full-time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":296,"utterance":" I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":"My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Do you know any places ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" How much do are you looking to spend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Anything you need to have in the place ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" You can also check out university bulletin boards . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":297,"utterance":" Good luck . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":298,"utterance":"Excuse me , but can I draw on my account for payment of things I buy in China ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":304,"utterance":" That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":304,"utterance":" I realize that now . I will do that after a while . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":304,"utterance":" Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":344,"utterance":"Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":344,"utterance":" What do you need ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":344,"utterance":" I need to talk to you about that new driver you \u2019 Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":344,"utterance":" He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":345,"utterance":"I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? ","emotion":"disgust"}
{"id":345,"utterance":" I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":"hey , you look great ! how's everything ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" it's important to do proper exercises . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" sounds reasonable . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" and fruits ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":346,"utterance":" you bet it ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":347,"utterance":"Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":347,"utterance":" I stayed with my friends . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":347,"utterance":" You should at least give me a call . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":347,"utterance":" I'm sorry , Mum . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":348,"utterance":"Did anyone call ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":348,"utterance":" Just Mr . White . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":348,"utterance":" What did he want ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":348,"utterance":" He wouldn't say over the phone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":349,"utterance":"What kind of job do you intend to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":349,"utterance":" I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":349,"utterance":" What are your plans if you were hired ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":349,"utterance":" I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":350,"utterance":"You stepped on my foot ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":350,"utterance":" Sorry . I didn't mean to . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":351,"utterance":"what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" why not ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":351,"utterance":" you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":352,"utterance":"Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":352,"utterance":" This is he . Who \u2019 s calling , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":352,"utterance":" This is Chris Emerson speaking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":352,"utterance":" Hello , Chris . How can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":353,"utterance":"Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":353,"utterance":" Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":353,"utterance":" Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":353,"utterance":" No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":353,"utterance":" Of course , let me find one for you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":354,"utterance":"Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":354,"utterance":" Sorry , it \u2019 s all sold out . ","emotion":"sadness"}

{"id":354,"utterance":" Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":354,"utterance":" Certainly . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":355,"utterance":"Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":355,"utterance":" Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":355,"utterance":" Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":355,"utterance":" Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":"Overseas operator , may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Yes . I would like to place a collect call . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Terry and his number is 4562325 8 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":356,"utterance":" Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":"Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" I would like to help you with both . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" A dressy party would be fun ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" We should probably have both . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" Maybe we could do both ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":357,"utterance":" Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":358,"utterance":"I can't find the price tag . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":358,"utterance":" It's right here . $ 100 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":358,"utterance":" But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":358,"utterance":" Ours are of really good quality . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":358,"utterance":" I see , please wrap it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":359,"utterance":"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":359,"utterance":" Well , I swim and run every day . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":359,"utterance":" Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":359,"utterance":" What do you drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":"Where can I call a taxi ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":360,"utterance":" There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":"How did your company's fundraiser go ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":361,"utterance":" In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":362,"utterance":"How may I help you today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":362,"utterance":" I need to open a second account . ","emotion":"neutral"}

Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":365,"utterance":" Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":365,"utterance":" What other things do I need to know ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":395,"utterance":" Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":395,"utterance":" For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":396,"utterance":" So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":396,"utterance":" Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":396,"utterance":" Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it \u2019 s all set right ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":396,"utterance":" No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":401,"utterance":" That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":401,"utterance":" Not at all . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":402,"utterance":"Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":402,"utterance":" OK ! Thank you very much ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":403,"utterance":"I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Good , if you \u2019 ll excuse me , I \u2019 ll go over the sheet right now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Take your time . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" I \u2019 m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That \u2019 s reasonable , isn \u2019 t it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you \u2019 ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let \u2019 s settle that matter first . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Well , as I \u2019 Ve said , if your order is large enough , we \u2019 re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" When I say your prices are much too high , I don \u2019 t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It \u2019 s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":403,"utterance":" Very well , I will . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":404,"utterance":"Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":404,"utterance":" Right ? OK , got it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":404,"utterance":" Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":404,"utterance":" Next left then right ? OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" I'm trying to find a post office . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Should I take the bus ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":405,"utterance":" Anytime . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":406,"utterance":"It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" So you must be an extravert ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Don't you consider it a hard work ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Hard but interesting , I think . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":406,"utterance":" Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":"Didn \u2019 t you punch in this morning , Monica ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Sorry , I don \u2019 t know the rule about punching . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" That \u2019 s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Do we also need to punch out after work ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o \u2019 clock and punch out after 5 o \u2019 clock every work day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" How about the lunch break , Lucy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" From 11 thirty to 1 o \u2019 clock . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":407,"utterance":" Sometimes , but not quite often . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":408,"utterance":"This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":408,"utterance":" Let me see . We \u2019 ll try , but I \u2019 m not sure that we can remove it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":408,"utterance":" Ok , then . We \u2019 ll I \u2019 d also like to have this pressed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":408,"utterance":" Any starch ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":408,"utterance":" No starch . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":"What's the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" I have a laceration on my left forearm . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Let me have a look . How did this happen ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" I got hit by a car in an accident . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Was there much bleeding afterward ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" No , not much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Will I need stitches ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":409,"utterance":" Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":410,"utterance":" What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ? ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" You only care about your work . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":410,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":412,"utterance":" When it comes to that , I have a lot to say . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":412,"utterance":" Then say it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":412,"utterance":" When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":412,"utterance":" That \u2019 s just what I want to know . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":412,"utterance":" He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":414,"utterance":" This is too good to be true . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":414,"utterance":" And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":414,"utterance":" Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":414,"utterance":" It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":414,"utterance":" We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":416,"utterance":"Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Is there any flexibility on that ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Unfortunately , not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":416,"utterance":" Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":417,"utterance":"Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":418,"utterance":" Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" I see , and what about the keyboard ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":418,"utterance":" Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":419,"utterance":"There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Luckily we got the last two . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" I really admire those who made such great inventions ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" No , quite the contrary . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":419,"utterance":" Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":"What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" I need some medicine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" For whom ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" What symptoms does she have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" Fever and a bad cough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" What kind of medicine does she need ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" Patulin will be enough . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" How many pills for each time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":420,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":421,"utterance":"Do you believe in god ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" Not at all . I \u2019 m an agnostic . do you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" I \u2019 m not sure . Why don \u2019 t you believe there is a god ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn \u2019 t explained yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" I \u2019 m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" For example ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":421,"utterance":" Yes . Such people don \u2019 t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":422,"utterance":"Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":422,"utterance":" You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":423,"utterance":"What a terrible house ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":423,"utterance":" I'm sick of it , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":423,"utterance":" The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":423,"utterance":" It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":423,"utterance":" Sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":424,"utterance":"Hello ! ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":426,"utterance":" 50 dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" 50 dollars . That's too much . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" I don't like that one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":426,"utterance":" That's nice . How much is it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":431,"utterance":" Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":431,"utterance":" Wow , you are the expert on it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":432,"utterance":"Operator . Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":432,"utterance":" To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":432,"utterance":" May I have your name and telephone number ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":432,"utterance":" What the number I gave you , operator ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":432,"utterance":" Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":432,"utterance":" Are you sure this time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":433,"utterance":" I'll tell them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":433,"utterance":" Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":434,"utterance":" The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":434,"utterance":" Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":434,"utterance":" Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":434,"utterance":" Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":434,"utterance":" I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":"Did you ever get a parking ticket ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" Only a few . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" What's a few ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" I've gotten six , I think . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" Did you pay your fines ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" Of course I have . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" How much are the parking tickets ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" I think they're $ 130 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" That's expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" I just got a parking ticket . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" You should probably pay the fine soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":435,"utterance":" I'm going to pay it today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":"Are you doing anything right now , Diana ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Is it urgent ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Ok , I am coming . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" No , I \u2019 d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":436,"utterance":" Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":"You're finally here ! What took so long ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" It would be better for the environment , too . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":437,"utterance":" Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":438,"utterance":"That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":438,"utterance":" I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":438,"utterance":" That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":438,"utterance":" Sure , for at least three thousand per month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":438,"utterance":" That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":438,"utterance":" I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":439,"utterance":"Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" They'll be ready by this afternoon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" Is that right ? We're very sorry . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" I thought it was \" the same day \" service.Anyway , please do hurry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":439,"utterance":" Yes , we'll do so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":440,"utterance":"Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":440,"utterance":" I want to effect payment under an L \/ C today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":440,"utterance":" No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":440,"utterance":" That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":440,"utterance":" It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":"How can I help you , sir ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" Sorry , could you tell me your name ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" Do you have an appointment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":441,"utterance":" She will be back soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":"Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":" Sure . May I take your measurements ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":" Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":" I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":" The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":" Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":442,"utterance":" That's fine , thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":443,"utterance":"Good morning everyone . Thank you for attending the meeting today . I'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . So let's get started with the first issue . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":443,"utterance":" We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":443,"utterance":" I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":444,"utterance":"It seems that many boys are fighting there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":444,"utterance":" Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":445,"utterance":"the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" I see , so it's similar to global warming ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" they're related to one another , yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":445,"utterance":" I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":446,"utterance":"Would you like some cookies ? I just made them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":446,"utterance":" Thank you . Yes , I would . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":446,"utterance":" These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":446,"utterance":" I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":446,"utterance":" No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":448,"utterance":" Oh yes . I \u2019 Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":448,"utterance":" You really shouldn \u2019 t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":448,"utterance":" Ok , I \u2019 Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don \u2019 t I ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":448,"utterance":" Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":448,"utterance":" I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":448,"utterance":" That \u2019 s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":448,"utterance":" These machines aren \u2019 t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":449,"utterance":"Hello , is Jennifer in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":449,"utterance":" I am sorry , you have the wrong number . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":449,"utterance":" Oh , I am really sorry . ","emotion":"sadness"}

{"id":499,"utterance":" That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":499,"utterance":" Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":499,"utterance":" Exactly ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest .

I wouldn \u2019 t feel comfortable investing in this climate . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":541,"utterance":" But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I \u2019 m not talking about investing in the domestic market .

Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":542,"utterance":" I see . And how about the working hours ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that \u2019 s not really a shock for me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" Good , as long as you understand that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":542,"utterance":" And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":543,"utterance":" Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":543,"utterance":" Looks good ! I \u2019 ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":561,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":571,"utterance":"David , how is your interview ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":571,"utterance":" I was nervous at that time . What about you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":571,"utterance":" Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":571,"utterance":" We can have a rest now after this tough interview . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":571,"utterance":" Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":573,"utterance":"Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":573,"utterance":" En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":573,"utterance":" There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":573,"utterance":" What's the charge ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":573,"utterance":" Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":573,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":574,"utterance":"Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":574,"utterance":" Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it \u2019 s showing your respect to your co-workers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":574,"utterance":" Well , but for this one , don \u2019 t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":574,"utterance":" Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":574,"utterance":" I didn \u2019 t pay attention to that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":"Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" So which form of transport do you prefer to use ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" I prefer going by train , even though it costs more . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":575,"utterance":" We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":576,"utterance":"Did you hear about Lulu ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":576,"utterance":" No , what ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":576,"utterance":" She and Vic broke up and now she \u2019 s asked for a transfer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":576,"utterance":" Get out of here ! I didn \u2019 t even know they were dating ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":576,"utterance":" No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":577,"utterance":"Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":577,"utterance":" Well , I'm not too happy about it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":577,"utterance":" What's wrong with it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":577,"utterance":" Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":577,"utterance":" Oh , dear ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":578,"utterance":"Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":579,"utterance":" You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":579,"utterance":" You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn \u2019 t sleep well . What \u2019 s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":580,"utterance":"What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There \u2019 s a grocery store just around the corner . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" What about things other than food ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" Are there small shops near here as well ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" Well , that sounds just wonderful . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":580,"utterance":" Yes , it \u2019 s a really nice neighborhood . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":581,"utterance":"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":581,"utterance":" Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":581,"utterance":" But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":581,"utterance":" But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":581,"utterance":" Well , only you liked it really , darling . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":581,"utterance":" Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":"Hi , Bob , everything okay ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" Oh ? What's that ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" What gift ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" You refused the gift ? That's terrible . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":582,"utterance":" That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":"I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":583,"utterance":" Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":586,"utterance":" We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":586,"utterance":" Do you need to be located in a particular school district ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":586,"utterance":" It doesn \u2019 t matter , as we do not have any children . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":586,"utterance":" Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":586,"utterance":" In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":586,"utterance":" Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":606,"utterance":" According to some studies it may cause cancer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":606,"utterance":" Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":606,"utterance":" I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":607,"utterance":" Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":607,"utterance":" Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge .

{"id":618,"utterance":" Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":618,"utterance":" Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":618,"utterance":" I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":619,"utterance":"I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":619,"utterance":" Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":624,"utterance":" What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":624,"utterance":" Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":624,"utterance":" Yes , 20 % would be perfect . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":624,"utterance":" Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":624,"utterance":" Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":627,"utterance":" Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" Well , do you have any suggestions ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" OK . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":627,"utterance":" Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":629,"utterance":" No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":630,"utterance":"What's our target audience for this campaign ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":630,"utterance":" This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":630,"utterance":" Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":630,"utterance":" Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":630,"utterance":" Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":630,"utterance":" Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":631,"utterance":"John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . ","emotion":"neutral"}

","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":631,"utterance":" Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":631,"utterance":" Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":631,"utterance":" Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":631,"utterance":" You've earned it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":"How can I help you today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" I am returning something that I bought yesterday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" What would you like to return ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" I'm returning a cellphone . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" Was there something wrong with it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" It's defective . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" What isn't working on it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" It keeps turning off on it's own . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" Alright , do you have the receipt ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" I have it right here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":632,"utterance":" I'm going to take care of this and refund your money . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":634,"utterance":" Good morning . I'd like to cash this check . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" What about the driving license ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" Don't you have any other identification ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" Thank you . Here you are . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" How do you want your money ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":634,"utterance":" All right . Please wait for a moment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":635,"utterance":"Could you fill in this form , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":635,"utterance":" All right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":635,"utterance":" Have you got any identification ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":635,"utterance":" Yes , here's my ID card . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" What ? What did you buy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! ","emotion":"anger"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" And ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" And it's a brick ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":636,"utterance":" You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":"Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I \u2019 m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20\/20 vision . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can \u2019 t quite make out the other symbol but I think it \u2019 s the peace sign . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Wow , Arthur ! You \u2019 re as blind as a bat ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Thanks doc ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":637,"utterance":" Arthur , that \u2019 s the bathroom . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":"Would you like some more coffee ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" Good luck finding the waitress ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" I think that we should leave 10 % . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":638,"utterance":" $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":639,"utterance":"I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":641,"utterance":"A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":641,"utterance":" Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":641,"utterance":" Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":641,"utterance":" Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":641,"utterance":" But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":641,"utterance":" Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":642,"utterance":"Would you care for a drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":642,"utterance":" No , thanks . I'm fine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":"Let's go practice your driving . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" If that's what you want to do , then we can . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" Did you buckle your seatbelt ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" I'm buckled up . What's next ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" You need to start the car now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" What do you want me to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" Go left . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" How far should I go ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" I'll let you know when I want you to stop . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" Tell me before you want me to stop . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" All right , try parking here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":643,"utterance":" Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":644,"utterance":"How may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":644,"utterance":" I would like to deposit a check . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":644,"utterance":" You need to sign the back . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":645,"utterance":" What is the reason for extension ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":645,"utterance":" I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master \u2019 s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":645,"utterance":" We \u2019 ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":"Do you like the apartment ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" I absolutely love the apartment . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":646,"utterance":" I do have one problem with the apartment . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" What \u2019 s the problem ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":646,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t like all those stains in the carpet . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":646,"utterance":" It \u2019 s absolutely incredible . I \u2019 ll take it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":647,"utterance":"Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Good morning . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Would you like something to drink ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" So , you're a serious coffee drinker . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Yes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" What do you suggest ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" You mean because people have to go across town to get here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Well . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" You mean you want to run the meetings ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":647,"utterance":" I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this \" new style . \" ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":"Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" Sure . How about this one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" Is this the latest edition ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" What's the difference ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" The hardcover is more expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":648,"utterance":" Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":649,"utterance":"Oriental China Airlines . Good morning , may I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":649,"utterance":" What's the departure time ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" 2:30 ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":649,"utterance":" First class or economy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" First class will be preferred . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":649,"utterance":" Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":649,"utterance":" You may take it up at the ticket office . That is located on International Street 150 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":"Where are you feeling the pain ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" I can \u2019 t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" It hurts smack in the middle of my gut ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" Did this just come on suddenly ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" No , and I don \u2019 t usually get a lot of stomachaches . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":650,"utterance":" I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":"May I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Yes , I would like to exchange some money . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" what currency would you like to trade in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":651,"utterance":" I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":"Has your son started school yet , Tom ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" Next week , it \u2019 s going to be quite a shock for him ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" He \u2019 ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":652,"utterance":" You bet . I wouldn \u2019 t miss it ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":653,"utterance":"May I speak to Mr.Huang , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":653,"utterance":" Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9 ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":654,"utterance":" Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":691,"utterance":"Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company \u2019 s dress code . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":691,"utterance":" Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":692,"utterance":"Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":694,"utterance":" How about two inches ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":694,"utterance":" Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":695,"utterance":" I wonder if there was an accident . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":710,"utterance":" OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can \u2019 t guarantee we can remove it completely . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":710,"utterance":" Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":710,"utterance":" Certainly . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":712,"utterance":"My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" Thanks . It \u2019 s nothing special actually . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" Don \u2019 t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":712,"utterance":" You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":714,"utterance":" Totally agree . What is your solution ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" But I don \u2019 t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":714,"utterance":" I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":719,"utterance":" You are right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":719,"utterance":" I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":719,"utterance":" OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":719,"utterance":" All right . I will take one . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":720,"utterance":"It's so boring . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" Don't you like it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" Do you mind if we switch over ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" Well , I'd rather see a movie . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" What's the movie ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" ' Star war ' . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":720,"utterance":" It must be interesting . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":721,"utterance":"Where can I get my baggage ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":721,"utterance":" Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":721,"utterance":" An international one from Seattle . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":761,"utterance":" Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":761,"utterance":" Well , the bigger the better , I think . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":761,"utterance":" Look at this one . It's our biggest pan . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":761,"utterance":" Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":802,"utterance":" Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":804,"utterance":"There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":804,"utterance":" Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":"Ahhchooo ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":805,"utterance":" Consider yourself lucky . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" What are all the symptoms ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":805,"utterance":" No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":805,"utterance":" Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":806,"utterance":" No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":807,"utterance":"What do you do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":807,"utterance":" I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":"I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" What about cats ? They are more independent . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Yeah , are they easy to look after ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":808,"utterance":" Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":"Can I be of any service to you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":809,"utterance":" So , we'd like to see some embroidery . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":"Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" I had some bread for breakfast . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Let's go out for brunch . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Brunch ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":810,"utterance":" Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":812,"utterance":"Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" They are both spicy hot , I've heard . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" They might be too hot for me . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":812,"utterance":" Is it near here ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":812,"utterance":" That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot . ","emotion":"happiness"}

{"id":834,"utterance":" Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":835,"utterance":"What would you have ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":835,"utterance":" I'll try Chinese wine . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":838,"utterance":" You didn't see the red light ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" Didn't you learn that red means stop ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" I know that . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":838,"utterance":" I'm not sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" I'm giving you a ticket for this . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":838,"utterance":" I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . ","emotion":"sadness"}

{"id":843,"utterance":" It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":843,"utterance":" I really don't care , just go to sleep . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":852,"utterance":" What kind of toothbrush do you use ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":852,"utterance":" I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":852,"utterance":" Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":852,"utterance":" Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":853,"utterance":" No , it's just the two of us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":853,"utterance":" Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":"Let's go to the animal shelter . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" What do you want to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" I want to get a puppy for my son . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" That will make him so happy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" I'll get him one of those little dogs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" One that won't grow up too big . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" And eat too much . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" Do you know which one he would like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" I bet you had to drag him away . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" He wanted to take it home yesterday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":854,"utterance":" I wonder what he'll name it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":"Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" Is there anything else ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" There are a mouse and a camera . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" Is that all ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" Please go over there to weigh them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":855,"utterance":" OK . See you later . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":"what happened ? Why didn't he win ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":856,"utterance":" let's hope so . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":"I need to use the ATM . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" What \u2019 s stopping you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" I \u2019 m not sure how . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" I don \u2019 t understand . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" I \u2019 Ve never used one before . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" I can help you figure it out . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" What do I have to do ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Slide your card into the machine . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Then what ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" You need to type your PIN in . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" What do I have to do next ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":857,"utterance":" Click on whichever option you want , and you \u2019 re done . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":"What are you doing ? Checking the \" to do \" list for the wedding ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Yep . There's still so much to do ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" So let's start by checking off what we've already done . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":858,"utterance":" Hey ! We're paying for his ticket ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":"It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Sounds good . May I have a look ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":859,"utterance":" OK , I will wrap them for you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":860,"utterance":"Can you make out what he's saying ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":860,"utterance":" No , it's too loud in here . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":"Excuse me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Yes ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Along Queen's Road ... ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Right at the Hilton . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" The Cathedral ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Yes . Why ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":861,"utterance":" Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":"Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" Where to ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" How about Karlis ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" I guess it is a little pricy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":862,"utterance":" You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":"Good morning , sir . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" Do you have a particular style in mind ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" Next Friday . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":863,"utterance":" Thank you . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":864,"utterance":"Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . ","emotion":"sadness"}
{"id":864,"utterance":" Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":864,"utterance":" Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":864,"utterance":" Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":864,"utterance":" I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":864,"utterance":" Good luck to us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":"Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" I have never been to the personnel market . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Really ? I have been there several times . ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Are there many employers ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Yes , there are many famous corporations . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" When will there be a job fair ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Every Saturday and Sunday ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" No , it's free . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" How about going there to have a look now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":865,"utterance":" OK , let's go . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":"Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" What's the price ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" $ 12 . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" Can you make it any cheaper ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" It is cheap . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" I'll take it if you give me a discount . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" $ 10 . That's the best I can do . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":866,"utterance":" OK . I'll take the blue one . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":867,"utterance":"Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":867,"utterance":" Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":867,"utterance":" Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":867,"utterance":" We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":867,"utterance":" That's not a problem . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":867,"utterance":" Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":867,"utterance":" Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":868,"utterance":"I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" We need to find a good realtor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" What do you mean ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Why ? ","emotion":"surprise"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":868,"utterance":" Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":869,"utterance":"I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":869,"utterance":" Sorry to hear that . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":869,"utterance":" How about next week ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":869,"utterance":" Fine , we'll be expecting you then . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":870,"utterance":"Which restaurant do you prefer ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":870,"utterance":" I'd like to taste Mexican food . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":870,"utterance":" How about the one on Baker Street ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":870,"utterance":" Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":871,"utterance":"The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":871,"utterance":" I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":"Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":" You \u2019 re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":" I \u2019 m actually travelling around Asia . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":" Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":" Probably another week . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":" Oh , I see . Well , I \u2019 ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":872,"utterance":" Thank you very much . That \u2019 s very kind . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":873,"utterance":"Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":873,"utterance":" Sure , but I have to finish this report first . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":873,"utterance":" Never mind . I'll do it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":"Are you interested in mountaineering ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" How did you spend the night there ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":874,"utterance":" I'd love to . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":875,"utterance":"Sir , what's wrong with you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . ) ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" Are you feeling better now ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" Much better now . Thanks again . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":875,"utterance":" My pleasure . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":876,"utterance":"Hi Bill , it \u2019 s Jane . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":876,"utterance":" Jane , I \u2019 m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":876,"utterance":" Sure . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":876,"utterance":" OK , I \u2019 ll be right back . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":877,"utterance":"Have you decided what you'd like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":877,"utterance":" Yes . First I'll have tomato juice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":877,"utterance":" And then ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":877,"utterance":" I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":"Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" Maybe sandalwood fan is good . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" Would you show me some ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" Of course . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":878,"utterance":" I'll take two small ones and a big one . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" What else are you interested in ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" I'm afraid not . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":878,"utterance":" OK . Here you are . ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":879,"utterance":"Good morning.Mrs.Smith . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" Well , what kind of books does she like ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" She's very fond of detective stories ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" I see.Has she read any detective stories ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" Oh , yes ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" Do you know if she's read this one ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" She's eighty-seven . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":879,"utterance":" Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ? ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":880,"utterance":"Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" Really ? What's the series about ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":880,"utterance":" Really ? that's interesting ! ","emotion":"happiness"}

Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ...

{"id":950,"utterance":" I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" So this would be your first automobile ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":950,"utterance":" I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":951,"utterance":"Can I help you ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":951,"utterance":" I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":951,"utterance":" Is it a photograph or a document ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":951,"utterance":" You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":951,"utterance":" Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":951,"utterance":" Couple of minutes . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":951,"utterance":" Great . How much ? ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":953,"utterance":" Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":953,"utterance":" No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":953,"utterance":" Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":953,"utterance":" It says ' Keep off the grass ! ' ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":953,"utterance":" Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":953,"utterance":" Be careful . You can't smoke here . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":954,"utterance":" Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds . ","emotion":"neutral"}

{"id":954,"utterance":" Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ? ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":954,"utterance":" The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby . ","emotion":"neutral"}
{"id":954,"utterance":" Thank you , you are very kind ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
{"id":954,"utterance":" You are welcome ! ","emotion":"happiness"}
